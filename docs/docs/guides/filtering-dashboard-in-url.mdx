# Filtering a Dashbaord in the URL

In this guide you'll learn how to format a dashboard URL to apply dynamic values to saved filters on that dashbaord. You can even set up a dimension so when you click on it you are sent to a dashboard that gets filtered based on the dimension you clicked!

For example, you might have a sales dashbaord that shows your most profitable Partners, then use a URL so that when you click on a specific partner name it brings you to a new dashboard that is filtered to show KPIs filtered to that partner.

Here's a quick walk through video that shows what it looks like once it's complete:

<div
  style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: '65%',
    height: 0,
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/5ba2d4b3ad8445b18e1ad233a4c0f930?sid=934496c3-959b-433a-809d-0d19d1a1081d"
    frameborder="0"
    webkitallowfullscreen
    mozallowfullscreen
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>


And this is the process for setting it up:

    frameborder="0"
    webkitallowfullscreen
    mozallowfullscreen
    allowfullscreen
    style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: '100%',
      height: '100%',
    }}
  ></iframe>
</div>


1. Open the dashboard you want to dynamically filter.
2. Add a value to the filter you want to filter dynamically. 
3. Copy the URL shown after applying the filter. It should look something like the image below. 

<img src={DashboardURLFilter} />;

_You'll notice there's a `?filters=` key in the URL. Everything after that is a JSON object that has been URL encoded. If you want to see the JSON you can find a URL decoder online to reformat it._

4. Replace the filter value that you chose in step 2 with `${ value.formatted | url_encode }` to make it dynamic. In the example the value is `Plant+Paradise` (highlighted in the image). 
5. Paste that URL into the YAML file for the model you're working in. See an [example in our demo project here](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash-demo-data-gardening/blob/5632406cb5b43fdf066a2086142dc3e86a41e947/dbt/models/dbt_orders.yml#L31-L32).
