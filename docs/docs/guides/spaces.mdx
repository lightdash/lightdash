# Spaces

Once you've used Lightdash for a while, your team will probably end up with a lot of saved charts and dashboards. Spaces let you organize your saved charts and dashboards. 

They're kind of like folders except you can't nest Spaces (you can't put a Space inside of a Space). All saved chart and dashboards exist in a Space and can only be in one Space at a time.

To access Spaces, you can either select a Space from the drop-down list in `Browse` or you can click on the Lightdash icon and select your Space from the homepage.

## Moving items between Spaces

To move a saved chart or dashboard between Spaces, you can click on the three dot menu (`...`) to the right of the item and pick the `Move to Space` action.

You can also add items to a Space from within the Space. Just click on the `Add` button by the saved charts or the dashboards section of the page. If you select an item that's in another Space, it will get moved to the Space you're adding it to.

You select multiple items to add at the same time to your Space.

## Updating and deleting Spaces

You can rename or delete your Space on the homescreen by clicking on the three-dot menu (`...`) for the Space.

<img src={RenameDeleteSpace} width="892" height="258" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

:::warning

Deleting a Space will delete all of the content in that Space.
