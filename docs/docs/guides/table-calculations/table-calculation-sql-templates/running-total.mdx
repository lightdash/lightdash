# Running total

Running totals give you the sum of a value + all of the previous values in that column.

[Just gimme the code! 👾](#heres-the-sql-you-can-copy-paste-to-calculate-the-percent-of-the-previous-value)

Here's an example of a running total:

<img
  src={RunningTotal}
  width="874"
  height="242"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

And here's the SQL used in the table calculation:

```sql
SUM(${orders.total_order_amount}) OVER(
  ORDER BY
    ${orders.order_date_month}
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```

In general, the SQL used for calculating running totals has two bits (with an optional third bit):

- `column_I_want_to_sum` - this is the column with the values you want to add up
- `column_I_want_to_order_by` - this is the column you want to order your running total over
- `optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by` - this column is optional and you can add as many more `order by` columns as you need. For your running total to only go up an increment of one row, you'll need to add every dimension in your results table to the `ORDER BY` bit in your SQL. And, the order of these will need to be the same as the ordering you've added to the columns in your results table.

### Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate a running total

```sql
SUM(${table.column_I_want_to_sum}) OVER(
  ORDER BY
    ${table.column_I_want_to_order_by},
    ${table.optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by}
  ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```

**💎 Level up your SQL**:

- You can specify if you want to order your columns in ascending order (1, 2, 3, 4) or descending order (4, 3, 2, 1) using the key words `ASC` and `DESC` in your `ORDER BY` clause.
  By default, a column will be ordered in ascending order - so if you want it ordered ascending, you don't need to add anything.

```sql
SUM(${table.column_I_want_to_sum})
  OVER(
    ORDER BY
      ${table.column_I_want_to_order_by} ASC,
      ${table.optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by} DESC
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
)
```
