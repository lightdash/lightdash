# Percent change from previous

The percent change gives you the percent change in a value compared to the value in the row above it.

[Just gimme the code! ðŸ‘¾](#heres-the-sql-you-can-copy-paste-to-calculate-the-percent-change-from-the-previous)

Here's an example of a percent change calculation:

<img
  src={PercentChange}
  width="846"
  height="425"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

And here's the SQL that was used to generate it:

```sql
(
  ${orders.total_order_amount} /
    LAG(${orders.total_order_amount}) OVER (
      ORDER BY
        ${orders.order_date_week}
    )
) - 1
```

In general, the SQL used for calculating the percent change from the previous value has two bits (with an optional third bit):

- `column_I_want_to_compare` - this is the column with the values you want to compare
- `column_I_want_to_order_by` - this is the column you want to use to order the values you want to compare
- `optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by` - this column is optional and you can add as many more `order by` columns as you need. Normally, you'll need to add every dimension in your results table to the `ORDER BY` bit in your SQL. And, the order of these will need to be the same as the ordering you've added to the columns in your results table.

### Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate the percent change from the previous

```sql
(
  ${table.column_i_want_to_compare} /
    LAG(${table.column_i_want_to_compare}) OVER (
      ORDER BY
        ${table.column_I_want_to_order_by},
        ${table.optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by}
    )
) - 1
```

### Make sure to add percent formatting to your calculation

In the `format` tab, make sure to update the format to `percent` so that your table calculation is shown as a percentage value (instead of a number).

<img
  src={FormatPercent}
  width="793"
  height="454"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>
