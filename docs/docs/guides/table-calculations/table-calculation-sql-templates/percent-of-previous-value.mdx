# Percent of previous value

The percent of previous value gives you the percent of a value compared to the value in the row above it.

[Just gimme the code! 👾](#-heres-the-sql-you-can-copy-paste-to-calculate-the-percent-of-the-previous-value)

Here's an example of a percent of previous value calculation:

<img src={PercentOfPrevious} width="1227" height="473" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

And here's the SQL that was used to generate it:

```sql
${pages.page_view_count} * 100 / 
  LAG(${pages.page_view_count}) OVER(ORDER BY ${pages.date_day}, ${pages.path})
```

In general, the SQL used for calculating the percent of the previous value has two bits (with an optional third bit):

- `column_I_want_to_compare` - this is the column with the values you want to compare
- `column_I_want_to_order_by` - this is the column you want to use to order the values you want to compare
- `optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by` - this column is optional and you can add as many more `order by` columns as you need. Normally, you'll need to add every dimension in your results table to the `ORDER BY` bit in your SQL. And, the order of these will need to be the same as the ordering you've added to the columns in your results table.

## 👀 Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate the percent of the previous value

```sql 
${table.column_i_want_to_compare} * 100 / 
  LAG(${table.column_i_want_to_compare}) OVER(
    ORDER BY 
      ${table.column_I_want_to_order_by}, 
      ${table.optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by}
  )
```

**💎 Level up your SQL**:

- You can round your table calculation to only show a certain number of decimal points. Here's an example where I only show two decimal points:

```sql
ROUND(
  ${table.column_i_want_to_compare} * 100 / 
    LAG(${table.column_i_want_to_compare}) OVER(
      ORDER BY 
        ${table.column_I_want_to_order_by}, 
        ${table.optional_other_column_I_want_to_order_by})
  , 2)
```
