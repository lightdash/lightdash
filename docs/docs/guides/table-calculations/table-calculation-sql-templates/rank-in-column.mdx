# Rank in column

Ranking values in a column is when you set every value as a number either higher than or lower than the other values. The lowest value (rank = 1) indicates the value with the first rank in your set of values.

[Just gimme the code! ðŸ‘¾](#heres-the-sql-you-can-copy-paste-to-calculate-your-rank-in-column)

Here's an example of a percent change calculation:

<img
  src={RankInColumn}
  width="845"
  height="426"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

And here's the SQL used to generate it:

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  PARTITION BY
    ${orders.order_date_month}
  ORDER BY
    ${orders.total_order_amount} DESC
)
```

In general, the SQL used for calculating the rank in a column has just one important column and one other important parameter:

- `column_i_want_to_rank` - this is the column that you want to rank
- `ASC` and `DESC` - if you want to have the **biggest values** with rank = 1, then you need to add `DESC` to your `ORDER BY` clause. If you want the **smallest values** with rank = 1 then you can add `ASC` to your `ORDER BY` clause (this isn't required, since the ordering is `ASC` by default).

### Here's the SQL you can copy-paste to calculate your rank in column

```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  ORDER BY
    ${table.column_i_want_to_rank} DESC
)
```
