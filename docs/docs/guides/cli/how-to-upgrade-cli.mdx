# Upgrading yoru Lightdash CLI

## Check compatability

Your Lightdash CLI version should match the version of Lightdash you see in the UI (scroll to the bottom of your screen, and you should see it there!). You can check the version of 
your CLI by running:

```shell
lightdash --version
```

If you need to upgrade your version of the Lightdash cli, run the following in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
lightdash --version
```
