# How to autogenerate Lightdash-ready .yml files for your models

The beauty of Lightdash is that we're pretty well synced with your dbt project. So, in Lightdash, Tables actually come from dbt models that have been defined in your dbt project's `.yml` files.

If your dbt model has been defined in a .yml file, it will appear in Lightdash as a Table.

## Auto-generate `schema.yml` files

To make it faster to write and maintain your `schema.yml` files, the Lightdash CLI will automatically generate and 
sync your `schema.yml` files.

Inside your dbt project, open a terminal and run this command to generate the `schema.yml` file for a model called 
`mymodel`:

```shell
git commit # make sure to commit all your existing project first!
lightdash generate -s mymodel
```

This will create or update an existing `schema.yml` file to add any new columns that have appeared in the database. 

## Auto-sync `schema.yml` files after `dbt run` 

Since the `generate` command relies on your database schema to detect which columns are required, you'll often want
to run `dbt run` before running `generate`. You can combine `dbt run` and `lighdash generate` into one command which 
will run models and then regenerate the 
`schema.yml` files for any models than changed:

```shell
git commit
lightdash dbt run  # Run dbt AND re-sync schema.yml files
```

## Generating `schema.yml` for multiple models

`lightdash generate` supports dbt model selection syntax to generate files for a group of models:
```shell
lightdash generate # all models
lightdash generate -s payments  # just payments
lightdash generate -s payments+ # payments and all children
lightdash generate -s +payments # payments and all parents
lightdash generate -s +payments+ # payments and all children and parents
lightdash generate -s tag:prod # all models with the prod tag
lightdash generate -s payments customers # two specific models
lightdash generate -s payments+ +customers tag:prod # mix and match
```

## Using doc blocks to build better .yml files

[Doc blocks](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation#using-docs-blocks) are markdown files defined in your dbt project that are useful for creating consistent documentation in your dbt project.

For example, if I have a field called `product_category` that's used a bunch of times throughout my project, I can create a doc block for this field:

```markdown
{% docs product_category %}

This is a string field that tells us the category of the product that was sold. This is a higher level grouping than the `product_type`. Every `product_type` maps to a single `product_category`. 

The valid product categories are:
- clothing
- home
- accessories
- beauty

{% enddocs %}

I can then reference this doc block in my .yml files like so:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: products
    description: "one row per product ID"

    columns:
      - name: product_category
        description: '{{ doc("product_category") }}'
```

The docs for `product_category` (in Lightdash and in your dbt documentation) will become the doc block I've written above.

### The Lightdash CLI will automatically add doc blocks to your .yml files

The nice thing about doc blocks is that Lightdash automatically adds these to the .yml files it generates. For example, if I had a .yml file for my `product_sales` model that looked like this:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: product_sales

    columns:
      - name: product_id
      - name: product_value
      - name: product_category
```

Then, I did:

```shell
lightdash dbt run -s product_sales # or lightdash generate -s product_sales
```

Then my `product_sales.yml` file would be updated to include the doc block for `product_category`:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: product_sales

    columns:
      - name: product_id
      - name: product_value
      - name: product_category
        description: '{{ doc("product_category") }}'
```

We reccomend using doc blocks whenever you can! They help with keeping the definitions of fields across your project consistent, and they also allow you to get great docs, completely automatically with the Lightdash CLI.
