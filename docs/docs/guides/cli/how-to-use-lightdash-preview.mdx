# Lightdash Preview

**Developer previews** are temporary Lightdash projects where you can safely experiment with your metrics, dimensions and charts
without affecting your production project.

Preview environments will copy all spaces/charts/dashboards into your new preview environment, so you can test the content
and also run [validation](/guides/cli/how-to-use-lightdash-validate). This is only copied on preview creation, you can't sync the content afterwards.

### Run `lightdash preview` from inside your project

```shell
# This will create a preview and will wait until you press a key to delete the preview project
lightdash preview
```

or

```shell
# This will create a preview and exit, you will have to run lightdash stop-preview to delete it
lightdash start-preview
```

Then `cmd` + `click` to open the preview link from your terminal. Once you're in Lightdash go to `Explore` --> `Tables`, then click on the model(s) you just updated to see your changes and play around with them.

**Problems with credentials?**

When you create developer previews, Lightdash will use the same warehouse connection settings you have in your
`profiles.yml` file for your current dbt project. This can be a problem if you're using a local database that your
laptop can reach but your Lightdash instance cannot.

## Set up developer previews on your pull requests

If you've connected Lightdash to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Lightdash to create new dynamic `preview` projects automatically
when a new `pull request` is created, and it will automatically delete the `preview` project when the `pull request` is closed or merged.

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets

If you haven't already set up a GitHub action for Lightdash, you'll need to add some secrets to GitHub. If you already have a GitHub action for Lightdash, then you can use the same Lightdash secrets you created for your other action.

<GithubSecrets />

### Step 2: Create start-preview.yml and close-preview.yml workflows in Github

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu, and click on `Configure`

![Github actions page](./assets/github-actions.png)

Now copy [this start-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/start-preview.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions) repo

And save by clicking on `Start commit`

Do the same with [this close-preview.yml file](https://github.com/lightdash/cli-actions/blob/main/close-preview.yml).

### You're done!

Everytime you create a new `pull request` , a new `preview` project with your `branch` name will be created on your organization.
Everytime you make a change to that branch, the preview environment will get updated.
Once you close or merge your `pull request`, the `preview` project will get deleted.

You can see the log on `Github actions` page

## How to use the developer credentials in your preview project

When developing in dbt, you typically have a different set of credentials and dataset/schema than when you are running in production.
Here are two options on how to set them up based on the developer that opened the Pull Request.

:::info
If you use dbt cloud IDE to create commits and pull requests you need a few extra steps.
We need to add a step in the GitHub action to fetch the user that created the pull request.

```yaml
- uses: actions/github-script@v6
  id: get_pr_creator
  with:
    script: |
      return (
        await github.rest.repos.listPullRequestsAssociatedWithCommit({
          commit_sha: context.sha,
          owner: context.repo.owner,
          repo: context.repo.repo,
        })
      ).data[0].user.login;
    result-encoding: string
```

When copying the following templates, you should replace `${{ github.actor }}` with `${{steps.get_pr_creator.outputs.result}}`.
:::

### Using profile targets

Update your `DBT_PROFILES` to have 1 target per developer. The target name should be their GitHub username.

```yaml
jaffle_shop:
  target: prod
  outputs:
    prod:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: prod
    katie: # example developer 1, should be GitHub username
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_katie
    jose: # example developer 2
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      keyfile: keyfile.json
      project: jaffle-shop
      dataset: dbt_jose
```

Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the `--target` flag for the `lightdash start-preview` command.

```yaml
run: lightdash start-preview --project-dir "$PROJECT_DIR" --profiles-dir . --name ${GITHUB_REF##*/} --target ${{ github.actor }}
```

### Using github environments

Setup a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) for each developer where the secrets are specifically for them. The environment name should be their GitHub username.
Then, update your GitHub action to use the username as the environment.

```yml
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: ${{ github.actor }}
```

## How to use the dbt cloud schema in your preview project

If you are using a [continuous integration job in dbt cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/ci-jobs), you can use the schema that is created by dbt cloud (`dbt_cloud_pr_<job_id>_<pr_id>`) for your preview project.

First we need to add an environment variable to your profile.yml file that will be used by dbt to connect to the correct schema.

```yaml
schema: "{{ env_var('DBT_SCHEMA') }}"
```

If you are using BigQuery, it should be `dataset` instead of `schema`.

Then we need to add a step in the GitHub action to fetch the pull request id.

```yaml
- uses: actions/github-script@v6
  id: pr_id
  with:
    script: |
      if (context.issue.number) {
        // Return issue number if present
        return context.issue.number;
      } else {
        // Otherwise return issue number from commit
        return (
          await github.rest.repos.listPullRequestsAssociatedWithCommit({
            commit_sha: context.sha,
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
          })
        ).data[0].number;
      }
    result-encoding: string
```

After that we need to add a new env variable to the step "Lightdash CLI start preview" which is the schema that dbt cloud will use.

Note that in this example we assume the job id is `1234`. You will need to replace this with the actual job id.

```yaml
env:
  # ... keep existing env variables
  DBT_SCHEMA: 'dbt_cloud_pr_1234_${{steps.pr_id.outputs.result}}'
```

Now dbt will use the correct schema when running in the preview environment.
