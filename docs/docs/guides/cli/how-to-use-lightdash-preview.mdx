# How to use `lightdash preview` to create a developer preview environment

**Developer previews** are temporary Lightdash projects where you can safely experiment with your metrics and charts 
without affecting your production project.

Follow the instructions above and when you're ready to preview your dbt project, run the following from inside your 
project:

```shell
dbt compile
lightdash preview
```

Then `cmd` + `click` to open the preview link from your terminal. Once you're in Lightdash go to `Explore` --> `Tables`, then click on the model(s) you just updated to see your changes and play around with them.

**Problems with credentials?**

When you create developer previews, Lightdash will use the same warehouse connection settings you have in your 
`profiles.yml` file for your current dbt project. This can be a problem if you're using a local database that your 
laptop can reach but your Lightdash instance cannot.
