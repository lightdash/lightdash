# Lightdash CLI

The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and 
easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

## Installation

To install Lightdash, you'll need to have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 
installed. Mac/Linux users usually already have `npm` available.

To install the latest Lightdash CLI, run the following on your command line.

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

Or install a specific version (eg: 0.162.0)

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli@0.162.0
```

You _may_ need to install an additional package if you see any errors:

**Mac OS**


```shell
brew install unixodbc
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

**Ubuntu**

```shell
sudo apt install unixodbc
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

## Authentication

Choose your preferred way to authenticate:

1. [Run **Login command**](#login) to use your email and password.
2. [Via **environment variables**](#environment-variables) to use a personal access token and help automate CI&CD pipelines.

### Login

To login to your Lightdash instance run the following command and provide your login email and password:

```shell
lightdash login https://my-lightdash.domain.com
```

where `https://my-lightdash.domain.com` is the address for your running Lightdash instance. For example Lightdash 
cloud users would type `lightdash login https://app.lightdash.cloud`.

**Note that if you are using Google SSO login you should authenticate via environment variables instead.**

### Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to authenticate yourself on each command:

- **LIGHTDASH_API_KEY** a personal access token you can generate in the app under the user settings
- **LIGHTDASH_URL** address for your running Lightdash instance

Example:

```shell
LIGHTDASH_API_KEY=946fedb74003405646867dcacf1ad345 LIGHTDASH_URL="https://app.lightdash.cloud" lightdash preview
```

### Set active project

When you login you'll be asked to set an active project. You can change your active project by running:

```shell
lightdash config set-project
```

Or you can use the `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT` environment variable to indicate what project UUID the command should use.

Example:

```shell
LIGHTDASH_PROJECT="3675b69e-8324-4110-bdca-059031aa8da3" lightdash deploy
```
