# How to install the Lightdash CLI

The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and
easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

To install the Lightdash CLI, run the following on your command line.

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

If you see any errors, you might need to install an extra package:

  **Mac OS**

  ```shell
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" # install homebrew if you don't have it
  brew install unixodbc
  npm install -g @lightdash/cli
  ```

  **Ubuntu**

  ```shell
  sudo apt install unixodbc
  npm install -g @lightdash/cli
  ```

## Once you've installed the CLI tool, [you'll want to authenticate it](/guides/cli/cli-authentication)
