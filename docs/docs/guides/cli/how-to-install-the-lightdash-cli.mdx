# How to install the Lightdash CLI

<details>
  <summary><b>Don't have NodeJS/NPM installed in your system?</b></summary>

We recommend installing NodeJS/NPM using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) which works for POSIX-compliant shells (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL)

Open your terminal and run the command below to install NVM (Node Version Manager) to your system.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
# or
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
```

Restart terminal and install NodeJS by running

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

Check that nodejs is installed by running

```bash
node -v
```

Running the command above should output something like `v16.18.0` which means you've succesfully installed NodeJS 🎉

Alternatively, you can [install NodeJS/NPM via your preferred package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and
easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

To install the Lightdash CLI, run the following on your command line.

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

If you get an `npm ERR! code EACCES` error while installing the Lightdash CLI, [follow this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) to resolve it.

## Once you've installed the CLI tool, [you'll want to authenticate it](/guides/cli/cli-authentication)

[Check out the guide on authenticating your CLI tool ](/guides/cli/cli-authentication)(login and setup an active project).
