# Sync your changes with Lightdash deploy

## `lightdash deploy` syncs the changes in your dbt project to Lightdash

If you've made some changes to your dbt project and you'd like to make them available in your Lightdash project, you can easily do this using the `lightdash deploy` command in the Lightdash CLI tool.

```shell
git checkout main # checkout main or master - or whatever your production branch name is where you've merged your changes
git pull
lightdash deploy # --target prod. If you use developer profiles in your dbt project, you might need this flag. See below.
```

This will deploy the changes in your dbt project to the Lightdash project you set up on your CLI tool earlier.

:::info

**Note:** Lightdash's deploy command will deploy using your **default dbt profile** unless you specify to use a different target. For example, if you've set up a developer profile where it targets a dev dataset (like `dbt_khindson.my_model_names`), then you'll need to pass the production target in your `lightdash deploy` command. Something like: `lightdash deploy --profile prod`.

And voil√†! Once it's completed click the URL to head straight to your project where your changes will be ready to be explored.
