# Pinning

You can pin important items so users are most likely to click on those items when they're navigating through Lightdash. Only users with editor or admin access to a project can pin items.

## Pinning items to your homepage

Your homepage is where users land when they first open Lightdash. You can access your homepage by clicking on the Lightdash icon in the top left corner of the app.

Pinned items on the homepage appear as the first group of items.

<img
  src={PinnedHomepage}
  width="837"
  height="585"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You should pin spaces, dashboards, or charts that are important to your organization or things you want everyone to see when they first open Lightdash. Things like a KPI dashboard or a "Key company insights" space are examples of what you might want to pin to your homepage.

### To pin an item, click on the three-dot-menu and select "Pin to homepage"

You can pin saved charts, dashboards, and spaces to your homepage. To pin an item, just click on the three-dot-menu beside the item, then click `pin to homepage`.

Only users who have editor or admin access to a project can pin items to the homepage.

### To unpin an item, click on the three-dot-menu and select "Unpin from homepage"

To remove an item from the list of pinned items, click on the three-dot-menu and select `unpin from homepage`.
