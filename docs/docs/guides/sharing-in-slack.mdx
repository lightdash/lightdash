# Sharing in Slack

Sharing in Slack allows you to unfurl Lightdash URLs on your Slack workspace.

If you are running a self-hosted Lightdash server, please check [Add Slack integration on self-hosting](https://docs.lightdash.com/self-host/customize-deployment/configure-a-slack-app-for-lightdash) first

## Adding Slack to your organization (Lightdash Cloud)

If you want to give slack access to your Lightdash organization, go to `Settings > Integrations` and click `Add to Slack` button.

<img
  src={SlackSettings}
  width="1338"
  height="659"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

This will redirect you to an OAUTH page to allow our App to access your Organization.

Currently we only need the following scopes:

- [links:read] for `lightdash.cloud` : Links to `lightdash.cloud` will be sent to our App
  so we can make an internal request and fetch information from charts and dashboards so we can later share it in slack.
- [links:write] : This allow us to unfurl the URL previously mentioned.

No other content will be shared from your workspace.

  src={SlackOauth}
  width="623"
  height="208"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

That's it

<img
  src={SlackApp}
  width="623"
  height="208"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Once our app has access to your Slack workspace, you can add Lightdash URL links and they will be
automatically unfurled with your chart or dashboard details.
