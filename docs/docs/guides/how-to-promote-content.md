# How to promote content

Promoting content enables you to copy content from one project to another. It's especially useful when working with preview or development projects. You can promote charts created in your development projects to production, so it's easy to test and make changes without the fear of breaking things in production.

## How promoting works

If you are promoting a chart, from one `development project` to a `production project`, this will happen:

- If the chart exists in both the `development project` and the `production project`, the chart in the `production` will be updated with the changes from `development`. You can always revert this chart to a previous version using [version history](./version-history)
- If the chart is new, we will replicate this chart into the `production project`. We will also create a new space if needed.

## Configure upstream project

Before you can start promoting content, you need to configure your upstream project.
To do this, on your `development project` go to settings > Data ops

In there, select the project where you want to copy the content to.

src={SelectProject}
width="668"
height="466"
style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

## Promote charts

You can promote charts from the `chart` in view mode or from any listing (like home page or all charts), click on the `...` button and then select `promote chart`

<img
src={PromoteViewChart}
width="160"
height="200"
style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

<img
src={PromoteListChart}
width="668"
height="466"
style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

:::info

You must be a `developer` and have access to the chart/dashboard/space in both the `development project` and the `upstream project`

:::

Once the chart is promoted, you can click on the `success` banner to open a new tab into this chart in the `production project`

/>
