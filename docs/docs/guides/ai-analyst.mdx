The Lightdash AI Analyst transforms the way you interact with your data by allowing you to ask questions in natural language and get meaningful insights back. Currently, you can interact with the AI Analyst via Slack with more options coming soon.

## How it works

Simply ask the AI Analyst questions about your data, and it will:

- Automatically select the most relevant data model and metrics to answer your question
- Build and execute queries with appropriate dimensions, filters, and limits
- Present results in the most insightful format - whether that's a visualization, table, or natural language summary
- Ask clarifying questions when needed to ensure you get exactly what you're looking for

## Preparing your data for the AI Analyst

To get the most out of the AI Analyst, it's important to properly prepare your metrics. The quality of the results depend on the quality of your metadata and documentation.

### Documenting your data

Good documentation is crucial for AI Analyst to understand your data models and provide meaningful insights. Here are some key tips:

- Write clear, descriptive names for metrics and dimensions that avoid acronyms or technical jargon
- Add detailed descriptions to all metrics and dimensions explaining what they represent.
- Descriptions can even include example questions that the AI Analyst could answer with the metric (e.g. "Useful for answering questions like 'What is the total revenue for the USA?'").
- Use business terminology that would make sense to any user, not just technical teams
- Include units of measurement where applicable (e.g. "Revenue in USD" rather than just "Revenue")
- Document any important caveats or limitations about the data

Remember: If your colleague wouldn't understand your documentation, neither will the AI Analyst. The more context you provide, the better the AI can interpret and analyze your data.
