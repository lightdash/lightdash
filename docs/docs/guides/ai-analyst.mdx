The Lightdash AI Analyst transforms the way you interact with your data by allowing you to ask questions in natural language and get meaningful insights back. Currently, you can interact with the AI Analyst via Slack with more options coming soon.

## How it works

Simply ask the AI Analyst questions about your data, and it will:

- Automatically select the most relevant data model and metrics to answer your question
- Build and execute queries with appropriate dimensions, filters, and limits
- Present results in the most insightful format - whether that's a visualization, table, or natural language summary
- Ask clarifying questions when needed to ensure you get exactly what you're looking for

## Preparing your data for the AI Analyst

To get the most out of the AI Analyst, it's important to properly prepare your metrics. The quality of the results depend on the quality of your metadata and documentation.

### Documenting your data

Good documentation is crucial for AI Analyst to understand your data models and provide meaningful insights. Here are some key tips:

- Write clear, descriptive names for metrics and dimensions that avoid acronyms or technical jargon
- Add detailed descriptions to all metrics and dimensions explaining what they represent.
- Descriptions can even include example questions that the AI Analyst could answer with the metric (e.g. "Useful for answering questions like 'What is the total revenue for the USA?'").
- Use business terminology that would make sense to any user, not just technical teams
- Include units of measurement where applicable (e.g. "Revenue in USD" rather than just "Revenue")
- Document any important caveats or limitations about the data

Remember: If your colleague wouldn't understand your documentation, neither will the AI Analyst. The more context you provide, the better the AI can interpret and analyze your data.

### Curating your data models

You can use tags in your metrics and dimensions definitions within your YAML file to control which fields the AI Analyst can access, focusing the AI on the most relevant data for analysis. By tagging specific fields, you ensure the AI only considers the data you choose to make available.

Here's an example of how you can tag your fields:

```yaml
- name: orders
  columns:
    - name: status
      meta:
        dimension:
          tags: ai #    <--------- tagging the dimension
    - name: amount
      description: Total amount of the order
      meta:
        metrics:
          total_order_amount:
            type: sum
            format: usd
            round: 2
            tags: ai #    <--------- tagging the metric
```

:::note

You can use any tags you like and as many as you like. The AI Analyst will only consider fields with the tags you specify in the Lightdash settings which you can find under the Organization / Integrations section.
