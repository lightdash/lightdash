# Using Filters

Filters appear at the top of the Explore view or dashboard and allow users to change the data being pulled into your charts.

For example, if I built a chart showing the revenue over time, but I wanted it to only have the revenue I made in France, I could add a filter for `country is equal to France`.

You can [add filters to your charts individually in the Explore view](#adding-filters-in-the-explore-view), or [across all of your charts in your dashboard](#adding-filters-to-your-dashboard). Don't worry, we'll walk you through both and you'll be a filter pro in no time!

## General filters tips

Here are some general tips about filters that apply to using them in both the Explore view and in dashboards.

### If you want to have multiple filters, just click `+ Add filter`

In the Explore view:

<img src={AddFilter} width="623" height="208" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>


Or in a dashboard:
<img src={AddMoreFiltersDashboard} width="461" height="125" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

### If you add multiple filters, you can choose to have `ALL` or `ANY` of the conditions match

To choose which option you want, just click on the drop-down menu on the top-left of the filters. 

<img src={MultipleFilterOptions} width="538" height="167" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

Selecting `ALL` conditions to match means you'd add an `AND` between your conditions in SQL. So, the example in the Explore view above would give us compiled SQL that looks like:

```sql
WHERE (
  (pages.source) IN ('lightdash_demo', 'lightdash_documentation')
  AND (pages.path) = '/20%crunchbase'
```

Selecting `ANY` conditions to match means you'd add an `OR` between your conditions in SQL. So, the example in the Explore view above would give us compiled SQL that looks like:

```sql
WHERE (
  (pages.source) IN ('lightdash_demo', 'lightdash_documentation')
  OR (pages.path) = '/20%crunchbase'
```

### If you want to include multiple values in your filter, just hit `enter` between each value entry in your list

<img src={MultipleValuesFilter} width="585" height="198" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

The listed values are separated by an OR statement in the compiled SQL. E.g. the above would give us:

```sql
WHERE (
  (pages.source) = 'lightdash_demo'
   OR (pages.source) = 'lightdash_documentation'
)
```

### To learn about the types of filters we have available, check out the filters reference doc.

Check out our [filters reference doc here](../references/filters.md) to see a list of all available filters and their uses.

## Adding filters in the Explore view

There are a couple of ways that you can add filters in the Explore view.

### Adding a filter from within the `Filters` tab

In the Explores view, you can add filters from within the `Filters` tab. Just click to open the toggle, then click `add filter`.

<img src={AddingFiltersFromToggle} width="516" height="251" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

Select the field you would like to filter from the drop-down list, then select the filtering options.

### Adding a filter from the sidebar

It's easy to add filters directly from the list of fields in the sidebar. Just click on the `options` for a field, then click `add filter`.

<img src={AddingFiltersFromSidebar} width="493" height="263" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

### Adding a filter from the results table

Once you have some results in your results table, you can add filters by clicking on the three-dot menu of the column you want to filter on, or by clicking on the value you want to filter by.

<img src={AddingFiltersResultsTable} width="608" height="553" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>


## Adding filters to your dashboard

There are a couple of ways that you can add filters to your Dashboards.

### Adding temporary filters to your dashboard

If you add a temporary filter to your dasboard, then only you will see the filters you've applied (you won't be changing the dashboard for everyone who comes to look at it). If you want to save the dashboard filters you're adding, then check out [adding saved filters to your dashboard](#adding-saved-filters-to-your-dashboard).

There are two ways to add temporary filters to your dashboard.

#### Adding temporary filters using the `add filters` button

1. Open up your dashboard.
2. Click `add filter`, then specify the field that you want to filter on and the value you want to filter by.

<img src={AddFilterDashboard} width="449" height="257" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

3. If you want, you can adjust which tiles the filter is applied to by clicking on the `Tiles` tab.

<img src={FilterTilesTab} width="646" height="802" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can remove the filter from a certain tile, or you can change which field the filter is applied to in a tile.

<img src={FilterTileAdjust} width="956" height="699" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

4. And voilà! Your filters will pop up on the top of your dashboard.

<img src={NewFiltersDashboard} width="543" height="188" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

#### `Cross filtering` your dashboard using values in your tiles

Cross-filtering lets you interact with one chart and apply that interaction as a filter to other charts in the dashboard. You can filter the dashboard using cross filtering by:

1. Clicking on one of the values in the chart.
2. Selecting the value you want to filter on from the drop-down list.

<img src={CrossFilteringDashboard} width="641" height="390" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

3. Now, your filter will pop up on the top of your dashboard.

<img src={NewFiltersDashboard} width="543" height="188" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

### Adding saved filters to your dashboard

If you add a saved filter to your dashboard, then anyone that opens the dashboard will see the saved filters applied.

To add saved filters, you just:

1. Open up your dashboard.
2. Make sure you're in `edit` mode (if you're not, you should see the option to click `edit` on your dashboard)

<img src={EditDashboard} width="435" height="180" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

3. Click `add filter`, then specify the dimension or metric that you want to filter on.

<img src={AddFilterDashboard} width="449" height="257" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

4. Your filters will pop up on the top of your dashboard.

<img src={NewFiltersDashboard} width="543" height="188" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

5. Once you have all of the filters you want, just hit `save` to save your filter settings.

<img src={SaveDashboard} width="459" height="171" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

6. Now, whenever someone opens the dashboard, they'll see your saved filters applied!

<img src={NewFiltersDashboard} width="543" height="188" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

To add saved filters to your dashboard, you must be an `editor` or an `admin` for your project.

### Some things worth mentioning about dashboard filters

#### Users can remove and override _saved filters_ on a dashboard while they're viewing it

Users have the option to delete or edit a dashboard's saved filters while they're looking at it. But, unless they're making these changes in `edit` mode and saving them, the original saved filters will be applied for the next user that comes to look at the dashboard.

<img src={EditRemoveFilters} width="455" height="351" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

#### You can easily see which dashboard tiles have which filters applied to them

If a tile in a dashboard has a filter applied to it, you'll see the text `dashboard filter applied` on the tile.

You can also hover over this to see **_which_** filters have been applied to that tile.

<img src={DashboardFilterApplied} width="490" height="395" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

#### Dashboard filters _are added to_ the filters applied in a saved chart so `ALL` the conditions match

For example, if I had a chart for Sales in Asia and I filtered to `country` **is equal to** `China`, `India`, `Japan`. Then, on my dashboard I added a filter `country` **is equal to** `India`. My saved chart's filter would still be included, and my new dashboard filter would be applied as well, so the tile in the dashboard would be filtered to include:

 `country` **is equal to** `China`, `India`, `Japan` AND `country` **is equal to** `India`

 So, the result? My tile would only include Sales where the `country = India`.

Here's another example using a date filter: If my original saved chart was filtered to only include orders completed on or after April 3rd, 2022. But, I add a date filter to my dashboard to include orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022, then the dashboard filter would be added to the saved chart filter and I'll end up with the chart filtered by orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022.
