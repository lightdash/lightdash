# Using Filters

Filters appear at the top of the Explore view or dashboard and allow users to change the data being pulled into your charts.

For example, if I built a chart showing the revenue over time, but I wanted it to only have the revenue I made in France, I could add a filter for `country is equal to France`.

You can [add filters to your charts individually in the Explore view](#adding-filters-in-the-explore-view), or [across all of your charts in your dashboard](#adding-filters-to-your-dashboard). Don't worry, we'll walk you through both and you'll be a filter pro in no time!

:::info

If you're a developer, you can add permanent filters to tables using the `sql_filter` yaml option. For more information see [Table configuration](../../references/tables#sql-filter)

## General filters tips

Here are some general tips about filters that apply to using them in both the Explore view and in dashboards.

### If you want to have multiple filters, just click `+ Add filter`

In the Explore view:

<img
  src={AddFilter}
  width="623"
  height="208"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Or in a dashboard:

<img
  src={AddMoreFiltersDashboard}
  width="461"
  height="125"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

### If you add multiple filters, you can choose to have `ALL` or `ANY` of the conditions match

To choose which option you want, just click on the drop-down menu on the top-left of the filters.

<img
  src={MultipleFilterOptions}
  width="538"
  height="167"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Selecting `ALL` conditions to match means you'd add an `AND` between your conditions in SQL. So, the example in the Explore view above would give us compiled SQL that looks like:

```sql
WHERE (
  (pages.source) IN ('lightdash_demo', 'lightdash_documentation')
  AND (pages.path) = '/20%crunchbase'
```

Selecting `ANY` conditions to match means you'd add an `OR` between your conditions in SQL. So, the example in the Explore view above would give us compiled SQL that looks like:

```sql
WHERE (
  (pages.source) IN ('lightdash_demo', 'lightdash_documentation')
  OR (pages.path) = '/20%crunchbase'
```

### If you want to include multiple values in your filter, just hit `enter` between each value entry in your list

<img
  src={MultipleValuesFilter}
  width="585"
  height="198"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

The listed values are separated by an OR statement in the compiled SQL. E.g. the above would give us:

```sql
WHERE (
  (pages.source) = 'lightdash_demo'
   OR (pages.source) = 'lightdash_documentation'
)
```

### To learn about the types of filters we have available, check out the filters reference doc.

Check out our [filters reference doc here](../references/filters.md) to see a list of all available filters and their uses.


## Adding filters in the Explore view

There are a couple of ways that you can add filters in the Explore view.


### Adding a filter from within the `Filters` tab

In the Explores view, you can add filters from within the `Filters` tab. Just click to open the toggle, then click `add filter`.

<img
  src={AddingFiltersFromToggle}
  width="516"
  height="251"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Select the field you would like to filter from the drop-down list, then select the filtering options.


### Adding a filter from the sidebar

It's easy to add filters directly from the list of fields in the sidebar. Just click on the `options` for a field, then click `add filter`.

<img
  src={AddingFiltersFromSidebar}
  width="493"
  height="263"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>


### Adding a filter from the results table

Once you have some results in your results table, you can add filters by clicking on the three-dot menu of the column you want to filter on, or by clicking on the value you want to filter by.

<img
  src={AddingFiltersResultsTable}
  width="608"
  height="553"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>


### Adding nested filters

You can add nested filters by clicking on the options button on the right-hand side of the filter and then click on `convert to group`.

<img
  src={ConvertToFilterGroup}
  width="856"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Then, you can add a new filter to the nested filter by clicking `add filter`.

<img
  src={NestedFilters}
  width="856"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>


## Adding filters to your dashboard

There are a couple of ways that you can add filters to your Dashboards.


### Adding temporary filters to your dashboard

If you add a temporary filter to your dasboard, then only you will see the filters you've applied (you won't be changing the dashboard for everyone who comes to look at it). If you want to save the dashboard filters you're adding, then check out [adding saved filters to your dashboard](#adding-saved-filters-to-your-dashboard).

There are two ways to add temporary filters to your dashboard.


#### Adding temporary filters using the `add filters` button

1. Open up your dashboard.
2. Click `add filter`, then specify the field that you want to filter on and the value you want to filter by.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboard}
  width="300"
  height="257"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

3. If you want, you can adjust which tiles the filter is applied to by clicking on the `Tiles` tab.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboardTile}
  width="502"
  height="624"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You can remove the filter from a certain tile, or you can change which field the filter is applied to in a tile.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboardTileEdit}
  width="741"
  height="518"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

4. And voil√†! Your filters will pop up on the top of your dashboard.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboardView}
  width="900"
  height="188"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>


:::note

Values for temporary and overriden saved filters are reverted when entering Dashboard edit mode.

:::


#### `Cross filtering` your dashboard using values in your tiles

Cross-filtering lets you interact with one chart and apply that interaction as a filter to other charts in the dashboard. You can filter the dashboard using cross filtering by:

1. Clicking on one of the values in the chart.
2. Selecting the value you want to filter on from the drop-down list.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboardCrossfilter}
  width="641"
  height="390"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

3. Now, your filter will pop up on the top of your dashboard.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboardNewFilters}
  width="543"
  height="188"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

### Adding saved filters to your dashboard

If you add a saved filter to your dashboard, then anyone that opens the dashboard will see the saved filters applied.

To add saved filters, you just:

1. Open up your dashboard.
2. Make sure you're in `edit` mode (if you're not, you should see the option to click `Edit Dashboard`)

<img
  src={EditDashboard}
  width="435"
  height="180"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

3. Click `add filter`, then specify the dimension or metric that you want to filter on.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboard}
  width="449"
  height="257"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

4. You can leave the value blank, or you can specify a value that you want to filter by:

   4.1. If you leave the value blank, then no filter will be applied to the tiles in your dashboard. Importantly, this provides dashboard viewers the option to define a value in the filter, enabling them to tailor the results to their needs.

   <img
     src={AddFilterDashboardEmptyValue}
     width="449"
     height="257"
     style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
   />
   4.2. If you want to specify a value, ensure you toggle 'Default value' so that
   you can apply a filter to the tiles in your dashboard.
   <img
     src={AddFilterDashboardDefaultValue}
     width="449"
     height="257"
     style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
   />

5. If you want, you can adjust which tiles the filter is applied to by clicking on
   the `Tiles` tab.

<img
  src={FilterTilesTab}
  width="502"
  height="624"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You can remove the filter from a certain tile, or you can change which field the filter is applied to in a tile.

<img
  src={AddTemporaryFilterDashboardTileEdit}
  width="741"
  height="518"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

6. Click `apply`, and your filters will pop up on the top of your dashboard.

<img
  src={DashboardFiltersReadyToBeSaved}
  width="543"
  height="188"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

7. Once you have all of the filters you want, just hit `save` to save your filter settings.

<img
  src={SaveDashboard}
  width="300"
  height="171"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

8. Now, whenever someone opens the dashboard, they'll see your saved filters applied!

<img
  src={DashboardFiltersSaved}
  width="543"
  height="188"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

9. And if they want to drill-down into the data, they can always change the filters by clicking on the filter and adjusting the values.

<img
  src={DashboardFiltersViewMode}
  width="543"
  height="188"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

:::info

To add saved filters to your dashboard, you must be an `editor` or an `admin` for your project.

### Some things worth mentioning about dashboard filters

#### Sharing your dashboard with overrides

You might want to share a dashboard with someone with custom filters applied. To do this, you have to be in _view mode_. Then, you can either/or:

1. Apply temporary filters to your dashboard and share the link with the filters applied.
2. Apply changes(overrides) to your saved filters and share the link with the filters applied.

Rules for sharing dashboards with filters applied:

- In view mode and when adding a temporary filter, you can change the field, value, operator, and tiles this is applied to. But, you can't change the filter type (e.g. from `temporary filter` to `saved filter`).
- In view mode and when overriding a saved filter, you can only change the value and operator, so the field and tile configuration will remain the same.
- In edit mode, when changing a saved filter (with an override present), once you save the changes (click "Apply"), the override for that filter will be removed.

The same behaviour applies when exporting dashboards or sending them to email or Slack in [scheduled deliveries](/guides/how-to-create-scheduled-deliveries).

#### You can easily see which dashboard tiles have which filters applied to them

If a tile in a dashboard has a filter applied to it, you'll see the text `dashboard filter applied` on the tile.

You can also hover over this to see **_which_** filters have been applied to that tile.

<img
  src={DashboardFilterApplied}
  width="490"
  height="395"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>


#### Dashboard filters override filters applied in a saved chart

For example, if I had a chart for Sales in Asia and I filtered to `country` **is** `China`, `India`, `Japan`. Then, on my dashboard I added a filter `country` **is** `India`. My saved chart's filter would be removed, and my new dashboard filter would be applied instead, so the tile in the dashboard would be filtered to: `country` **is** `India`.

Here's another example using a date filter: If my original saved chart was filtered to only include orders completed on or after April 3rd, 2024. But, I add a date filter to my dashboard to include orders completed on or after August 1st, 2024, then the dashboard filter would override the saved chart filter and I'll end up with the chart filtered by orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022.

**How charts work in this context:**

- When you **Explore from here** from a dashboard, the chart will include the same filters you saw on the Dashboard version. Any filters overriden in the dahsboard will be overriden in the **Explore from here** view. Filters NOT overriden in the dashboad will be the same as they were in the original chart. 
- If you 'Edit' the chart instead of explore from here, you will see the original chart filters.

Here's another example using a date filter: If my original saved chart was filtered to only include orders completed on or after April 3rd, 2022. But, I add a date filter to my dashboard to include orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022, then the dashboard filter would be added to the saved chart filter and I'll end up with the chart filtered by orders completed on or after August 1st, 2022.

#### Dashboard filters autocomplete

When determining possible values for a dashboard filter, the system will take into account all relevant filters, including those applied to fields from joined tables.

Example with payments and orders models:

```yaml
- name: customers
...
- name: orders
  meta:
    joins:
      - join: customers
        sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
...
- name: payments
  meta:
    joins:
      - join: orders
        sql_on: ${orders.order_id} = ${payments.order_id}
      - join: customers
        sql_on: ${customers.customer_id} = ${orders.customer_id}
```

Following this example:

- when filtering on a field from the `payments` model, the system will consider the filters applied to fields from the `payments`, `orders` and `customers` models
- when filtering on a field from the `orders` model, the system will consider the filters applied to fields from the `orders` and `customers` models
- when filtering on a field from the `customers` model, the system will consider the filters applied to fields from the `customers` model
