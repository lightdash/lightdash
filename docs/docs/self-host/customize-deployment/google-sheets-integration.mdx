# Configure a Google Sheets integration for self-hosted Lightdash

In this guide we will show you how you can [upload to Google Sheets in scheduled deliveries](/references/google-sheets) and
upload results from Google Sheets on `charts` on your on self-hosted Lightdash server.

### Enable Google SSO

To authenticate Google users, first you need to enable [Google SSO](https://docs.lightdash.com/self-host/customize-deployment/use-sso-login-for-self-hosted-lightdash#google) on your server.

If you still want to keep users to login via email/password or another SSO provider, you can set this `AUTH_GOOGLE_ENABLED` variable to `false`

### Create an API key for Google file picker

We use Google Drive picker API to allow you to select your spreadsheet files on `Syncs`

To create a Google Drive picker API you need to add a new API key in [APIs and services in Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Your Google project must have the following API's enabled:

- Google Drive API
- Google Picker API
- Google Sheets API

Save the API key in a new environment variable `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY`
