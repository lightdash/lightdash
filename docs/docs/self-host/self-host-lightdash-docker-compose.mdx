# Self-host Lightdash using docker-compose

This guide will give you a minimal Lightdash instance running on your local machine. It will not be accessible from
the internet, but it will be accessible from your local machine. This is a great way to get started with Lightdash
for a proof-of-concept without needing access to kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## 1. Clone the Lightdash repository

Clone the Lightdash code to your local machine. This will create a new directory called `./lightdash` (the Lightdash directory).

```bash
# Clone the Lightdash repo
git clone https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash
cd lightdash
```

## 2. Update your ENV config

Edit all the ENV variables in `.env` to match your setup, eg:

```
PGHOST=db
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=pg_user *OR* machine username if no prior postgres set up
PGPASSWORD=pg_password *OR* blank if no prior postgres set up
PGDATABASE=postgres
DBT_DEMO_DIR=/*path*/*to*/lightdash/project/examples/full-jaffle-shop-demo
```

## 3. Create containers

You must set the following two environment variables:

- `PGPASSWORD` is the password used for the internal postgres database
- `LIGHTDASH_SECRET` is the secret used to encrypt data at rest in the database. If you lose this secret, you will not be able to access your data in Lightdash.

```bash

export LIGHTDASH_SECRET="not very secret"
export PGPASSWORD="password"

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up --detach --remove-orphans
```

:::info

If you have a Windows machine and get the error **Error response from daemon: i/o timeout**.
Go to **Docker > Settings > General** and enable the option **Expose daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS**
