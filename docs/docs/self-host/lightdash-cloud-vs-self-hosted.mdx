# Lightdash Cloud vs. Self-Hosted

Lightdash is open-source and licensed under the MIT license. This means that you are free to self-host Lightdash on
your own infrastructure but without any warranty or support from the Lightdash team.

Self-hosting is great for hobbyist projects or if you want to go wild with a completely custom implementation (maybe
you'd prefer the whole app was translated into pirate-speak).
For most companies and teams, we recommend Lightdash Cloud.

To self-host Lightdash securely in production, you should have an excellent understanding of running services
with Docker and kubernetes, as well as the security considerations.

If you're unsure whether to self-host or use Lightdash Cloud, here are some things to consider:

## When to use Lightdash Cloud

Unless you have a specific need to self-host, we recommend using Lightdash Cloud:

- Suitable for most teams
- Get started with Lightdash quickly
- Secure and reliable out-of-the-box.
- No need to maintain your own infrastructure.
- Always have the latest version of Lightdash.
- Incredible support from the core Lightdash team and maintainers.

## When to self-host

There are a few reasons why you might want to self-host Lightdash:

- You're a large enterprise and want to run a proof-of-concept on your own infrastructure. This can be a great way
  to get your hands on Lightdash, while your infosec team approves the use of Lightdash Cloud.
- You're a hobbyist and want to run Lightdash on your own infrastructure.
- You want to customise Lightdash to your specific needs.
