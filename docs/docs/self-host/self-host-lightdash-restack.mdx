### One-click cluster creation with Restack

:::tip
Why do I need a cluster?<br/>
Running your application on a Kubernetes cluster lets you deploy, scale and monitor the application reliably.
:::
Once you have added your credentials,

1. Navigate to the _Clusters_ tab on the same page and click on _Create cluster_.
   ![create-cluster](./assets/restack-create-cluster.png)
2. Give a suitable name to your cluster.
3. Select the region you want to deploy the cluster in.
4. Select the AWS credentials you added in the previous step.
   ![cluster-details](./assets/restack-cluster-details.png)

The cluster creation process will start automatically. Once the cluster is ready, you will get an email on the email id connected with your account. <br/>Creating a cluster is a one-time process. From here you can add other open source tools or multiple instances of Lightdash in the same cluster.

### Deploy multiple instances of Lightdash

Restack makes it easier to deploy multiple instances of Lightdash on the same or multiple clusters. <br/>So you can test the latest version before upgrading or have a dedicated instance for development and for production.
