The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and
easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

Before installing Lightdash CLI, you need to have NodeJS/NPM installed on your machine. To check that, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
node -v; npm -v;
# it should print something like:
# v16.17.0
# 8.15.0
```

  <summary><b>Don't have NodeJS/NPM installed in your system?</b></summary>

We recommend installing NodeJS/NPM using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) which works for POSIX-compliant shells (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash on these platforms: unix, macOS, and windows WSL)

Open your terminal and run the command below to install NVM (Node Version Manager) to your system.

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
# or
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
```

Restart terminal and install NodeJS by running

```shell
nvm install --lts
```

Check that NodeJS is installed by running

```shell
node -v
```

Running the command above should output something like `v16.18.0` which means you've succesfully installed NodeJS/NPM 🎉

Alternatively, you can [install NodeJS/NPM via your preferred package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
