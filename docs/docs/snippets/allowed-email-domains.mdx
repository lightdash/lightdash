Organization admins can add allowed email domains to their organization settings so that anyone with those email domains can automatically join their organization (without explicitly inviting them).

To update your organization's allowed email domains setting, just go to the `general` organization settings.

  height="530"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

In the `allowed email domains` panel, enter the email domains you want to be able to automatically join your organization (e.g. here, we've added `lightdash.com`). Generic email domains like `gmail.com` or `hotmail.com` are not accepted.

You can then select the access that you want these users to have, by default. The organization admin can always update a user's permissions after they've joined the organization!

  src={AddingDomains}
  width="793"
  height="315"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

If you want to add default permissions that are different across each project, you can select the organization role of `organization member`, then set the project access for each project.

<img
  src={ProjectAccess}
  width="785"
  height="341"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Once you've selected the default roles for your allowed email domains, make sure to click `update` to save your changes.

<img
  src={UpdateDomains}
  width="798"
  height="339"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Now, when a user tries to join Lightdash, they will be prompted to join your workspace if they have one of your allowed email domains.

### Setting a Default Project

In the organization settings you can set a default project. This is the project users will see when they log in for the
first time or from a new device. If a user does not have access, they will see their next accessible project.
