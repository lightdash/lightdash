## What are metrics and dimensions?

Metrics and dimensions are defined in your dbt project alongside your dbt model properties.

- **Dimensions** are used to **segment data** in your Tables.
- **Metrics** are used to **perform calculations** on your Tables.

Say we're running an ecommerce business, we probably have a table containing all order data. We might want to
ask:

<img
  src={DataQuestion}
  width="1004"
  height="227"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

This question can be answered using a single metric "the total number of unique orders" and a single dimension for
splitting the metric by "status of order". In Lightdash you'd get the following chart:
