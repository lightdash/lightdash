# Update your project connection

To setup your Lightdash connection you'll need to:

1. Connect to your data warehouse (bigquery, postgres, redshift, snowflake, databricks)
2. Connect to your dbt project

## Open up your Lightdash instance to get started.

**To update an existing connection**, head to:

1.  `Settings`
2.  `Project management`
3.  `Settings` for your project

(see steps 1-3 in the image below)

**To create a new project connection**, head to:

1.  `Settings`
2.  `Project management`
3.  `Create New`

(see steps 1, 2 & 4 in the image below)

<img
  src={SelectSettings}
  width="1043"
  height="613"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

## 1. Connect to a warehouse

<img
  src={ChooseDatabase}
  width="300"
  height="277"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

We currently support:

1. [Bigquery](#bigquery)
2. [Postgres](#postgres)
3. [Redshift](#redshift)
4. [Snowflake](#snowflake)
5. [Databricks](#databricks)
6. [Trino](#Trino)

We always recommend giving read-only permissions to Lightdash, that way you ensure than no data can be manipulated. See each section below for warehouse specific details.

:::info

Since we host your Lightdash for you, you may need to add our static IP addresses to the allow-list for your security group or firewall rules so they don’t block calls from your Lightdash Cloud to your connected databases.

If you login at:

- **app.lightdash.cloud** use **35.245.81.252**
- **eu1.lightdash.cloud** use **34.79.239.130**

If you login at a different domain, look for the IP in the project settings page (see image below).
:::

![screenshot-ip-address](assets/screenshot-ip-address.png)

### Bigquery

#### Project

This is project ID from Google Cloud Platform for the data that you want to connect Lightdash to.

To find your project ID, head to the [BigQuery Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

Once you're in there, click on the project name in the top bar.

<img
  src={GetToProjects}
  width="417"
  height="104"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Then, you should see all of the projects and their project IDs in your organization (that you have access to).

<img
  src={ProjectIdList}
  width="553"
  height="203"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

For the project you want to connect Lightdash to, just copy its `id` and pop it into the `project` field in the Warehouse Connection form in Lightdash.

#### Data set

This is the default dataset used by dbt to compile and run your dbt project. You can find this in the dbt cloud IDE
or your local `profiles.yml` file.

If you're a dbt cloud user you can find this under your profile in the dbt cloud IDE:

<img
  src={DbtCloudCredentials}
  width="740"
  height="518"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

If you work with dbt locally, then check your `profiles.yml` file at `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` and look for a field
named `dataset`:

```yaml
my-profile:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: abc-123
      dataset: my_dataset # look for this one!
      ...
```

#### Location

The data location of the dataset in BigQuery where the output of your dbt models is written to.

`location` may be either a multi-regional location (e.g. `EU`, `US`), or a regional location (e.g. `us-west2` ). Check out the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations) for more information on dataset locations.

You can find the location of the dataset you're using for your dbt project [in your dbt `profiles.yml` file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/bigquery-profile#dataset-locations), or in your BigQuery console.

<img
  src={DataLocation}
  width="302"
  height="215"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

#### Key File

To connect to BigQuery, you'll need to have a service account that you can use with Lightdash. You can read more about [creating and managing service accounts with Google BigQuery in their docs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts).

:::info

If you're creating a new service account, make sure that you save your JSON key file somewhere safe! You'll need it for connecting to Lightdash.

:::

The service account you use with Lightdash will need to have the following roles in your GCP project:

- `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` (to see data in your project)
- `roles/bigquery.jobUser` (to run queries in your project)

If you need to provide access to data across multiple BigQuery projects, the service account will need to be granted `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` on each additional BigQuery project.

Once you have a service account all ready to go, you'll need to add its JSON key file to Lightdash in the `key file` section of the Warehouse Connection page.

#### Timeout in seconds

BigQuery supports query timeouts. By default, the timeout is set to 300 seconds. If a query run by Lightdash takes longer than this timeout to complete, then BigQuery may cancel the query and issue the following error:

```
Operation did not complete within the designated timeout.
```

To change this timeout, use the `Timeout in seconds` configuration.

#### Priority

The priority for the BigQuery jobs that Lightdash executes can be configured with the `priority` configuration in your Warehouse Connection settings. The `priority` field can be set to one of `batch` or `interactive`.

For more information on query priority, [check out the BigQuery documentation.](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries)

#### Retries

The `retries` configuration specifies the number of times Lightdash should retry queries that result in unhandled server errors.

For example, setting `retries` to 5 means that Lightdash will retry BigQuery queries 5 times with a delay. If the query does not succeed after the fifth attempt, then Lightdash will raise an error.

By default, the number of retries is set to 3.

#### Maximum bytes billed

If a value for the `Maximum bytes billed` is set, then queries executed by Lightdash will fail if they exceed the configured maximum bytes threshhold. This configuration should be supplied as an integer number of bytes.

For example, setting this to `1000000000` means if a query would bill more than a gigabyte of data (e.g. 2Gb), then BigQuery will reject the query and you'd get an error like this:

```
  Query exceeded limit for bytes billed: 1000000000. 2000000000 or higher required.
```

#### Start of week

This controls what day is the start of the week in Lightdash. `Auto` sets it to whatever the default is for your data warehouse. Or, you can customize it and select the day of the week from the drop-down menu. This will be taken into account when using 'WEEK' time interval in Lightdash.

#### Execution project

Here you can specify an execution project to bill for query execution, instead of using the project where your dbt resources are materialized. If you leave this blank, all costs get applied to the project from the top of the connection details.

---

### Postgres

You can see more details in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/postgres-profile).

#### Host

#### User

This is the database user name.

#### Password

This is the database user password.

#### DB name

This is the database name.

#### Schema

This is the default schema used by dbt to compile and run your dbt project. You can find this in the dbt cloud IDE
or your local `profiles.yml` file.

If you're a dbt cloud user you can find this under your profile in the dbt cloud IDE:

<img
  src={DbtCloudCredentials}
  width="740"
  height="518"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

If you work with dbt locally, then check your `profiles.yml` file at `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` and look for a field
named `schema`:

```yaml
company-name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: [hostname]
      user: [username]
      password: [password]
      port: [port]
      dbname: [database name]
      schema: [dbt schema] # look for this one!
```

#### Port

This is the port where the database is running.

#### Keep alive idle (seconds)

This specifies the amount of seconds with no network activity after which the operating system should send a TCP keepalive message to the client.
You can see more details in [postgresqlco documentation](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/tcp_keepalives_idle/).

#### Search path

This controls the Postgres "search path".
You can see more details in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/postgres-profile#search_path).

#### SSL mode

This controls how dbt connects to Postgres databases using SSL.
You can see more details in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/postgres-profile#sslmode).

#### Start of week

This controls what day is the start of the week in Lightdash. `Auto` sets it to whatever the default is for your data warehouse. Or, you can customize it and select the day of the week from the drop-down menu. This will be taken into account when using 'WEEK' time interval in Lightdash.

---

### Redshift

You can see more details in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/redshift-profile).

#### Host

This is the host where the database is running.

#### User

This is the database user name.

#### Password

This is the database user password.

#### DB name

This is the database name.

#### Schema

This is the default schema used by dbt to compile and run your dbt project. You can find this in the dbt cloud IDE
or your local `profiles.yml` file.

If you're a dbt cloud user you can find this under your profile in the dbt cloud IDE:

<img
  src={DbtCloudCredentials}
  width="740"
  height="518"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

If you work with dbt locally, then check your `profiles.yml` file at `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` and look for a field
named `schema`:

```yaml
company-name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: redshift
      host: hostname.region.redshift.amazonaws.com
      user: username
      password: password1
      port: 5439
      dbname: analytics
      schema: analytics # look for this one!
```

#### Port

This is the port where the database is running.

#### Keep alive idle (seconds)

This specifies the amount of seconds with no network activity after which the operating system should send a TCP keepalive message to the client.

If the database closes its connection while Lightdash is waiting for data, you may see the error `SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected`. Lowering the [`keepalives_idle` value](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/libpq-connect.html) may prevent this, because the server will send a ping to keep the connection active more frequently.

By default, this value is set to 240 seconds, but can be configured lower (perhaps 120 or 60), at the cost of a chattier network connection.

#### SSL mode

This controls how dbt connects to Postgres databases using SSL.

#### RA3 Node

Allow dbt to use cross-database-resources

#### Start of week

This controls what day is the start of the week in Lightdash. `Auto` sets it to whatever the default is for your data warehouse. Or, you can customize it and select the day of the week from the drop-down menu. This will be taken into account when using 'WEEK' time interval in Lightdash.

---

### Snowflake

You can see more details in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/snowflake-profile).

#### Account

This is your Snowflake [account identifer](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#format-1-preferred-account-name-in-your-organization).

The easiest way to find this is to login to snowflake in your browser and your account identifier is whatever comes
before `snowflakecomputing.com`.

For example in the image below, the user logs in via `https://aaa99827.snowflakecomputing.com/console/login#/` so
the account identifier is `aaa99827`.

<img
  src={SnowflakeAccountUrl}
  width="430"
  height="47"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

If you don't have access via the browser, you can use the following format `<organization_name>-<account_name>` where
`organization_name` and `account_name` can be found by following any of the methods listed in
[Managing accounts in your organization](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/organizations-manage-accounts.html#label-viewing-organization-name).

#### User

This is the login name for your Snowflake user. This is usually the same username you use to login to
Snowflake.

Alternatively, you can [create a new user through the snowflake console](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-user-management.html)
with a username and password specifically for Lightdash to use.

If you're a snowflake admin you can list all users available in the snowflake console:

<img
  src={SnowflakeUsersList}
  width="772"
  height="218"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

#### Password

This is the password your Snowflake user. This is usually the same password you use to login to Snowflake:

<img
  src={SnowflakeLoginForm}
  width="394"
  height="368"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Alternatively, you can [create a new user through the snowflake console](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-user-management.html)
with a username and password specifically for Lightdash to use.

If you're a Snowflake admin you can list all users available in the snowflake console:

<img
  src={SnowflakeUsersList}
  width="772"
  height="218"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

#### Role

This is the security role that you would like to use when running queries as the specified user. The role must have
access to any warehouses, databases, schemas, and tables you want to use.

If you're a Snowflake admin you can list all roles available in the snowflake console:

<img
  src={SnowflakeRolesList}
  width="635"
  height="192"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You can configure your role to allow read access to all warehouses, databases, schemas, and tables by following the
guide for
[Creating custom read-only roles](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-configure.html#creating-custom-read-only-roles).

#### Database

This is the name of your database. The specified user must be granted access to this database. You can see a list of
databases available in the snowflake console:

<img
  src={SnowflakeDatabaseList}
  width="473"
  height="266"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

#### Warehouse

This is the name of the warehouse you would like to use for running queries. The specified user must be grantend
access to use this warehouse. You can see al list of warehouses available in the snowflake console:

<img
  src={SnowflakeWarehouseList}
  width="386"
  height="203"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

:::info

If “Always use this warehouse” is set to yes, this warehouse will be used for all queries, even if the dbt configuration specifies a different warehouse using snowflake_warehouse.

:::

#### Schema

This is the default schema used by dbt to compile and run your dbt project. You can find this in the dbt cloud IDE
or your local `profiles.yml` file.

If you're a dbt cloud user you can find this under your profile in the dbt cloud IDE:

<img
  src={DbtCloudCredentials}
  width="740"
  height="518"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

If you work with dbt locally, then check your `profiles.yml` file at `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` and look for a field
named `schema`:

```yaml
my-snowflake-db:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      account: [account id]
      user: [username]
      password: [password]
      role: [user role]
      database: [database name]
      warehouse: [warehouse name]
      schema: [dbt schema] # Look for this one!
```

#### Keep client session alive

This is intended to keep Snowflake sessions alive beyond the typical 4 hour timeout limit.
You can see more details in [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/snowflake-profile#client_session_keep_alive).

#### Query tag

A value with which to tag all queries, for later searching in [QUERY_HISTORY view](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage/query_history.html))

#### Start of week

This controls what day is the start of the week in Lightdash. `Auto` sets it to whatever the default is for your data warehouse. Or, you can customize it and select the day of the week from the drop-down menu. This will be taken into account when using 'WEEK' time interval in Lightdash.

---

### Databricks

<img
  src={DatabricksAccessScreenshot}
  width="1097"
  height="647"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

#### Database

The default database name used by dbt for this connection.

#### Start of week

This controls what day is the start of the week in Lightdash. `Auto` sets it to whatever the default is for your data warehouse. Or, you can customize it and select the day of the week from the drop-down menu. This will be taken into account when using 'WEEK' time interval in Lightdash.

---

### Trino

We only support [LDAP authentication with Trino](https://trino.io/docs/current/security/ldap.html). You can see more details in [dbt's documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/trino-setup#configuration).

#### Host

The hostname of your cluster. E.g. `mycluster.mydomain.com`

Don't include the http:// or https:// prefix.

#### User

The username (of the account) to log in to your cluster. When connecting to Starburst Galaxy clusters, you must include the role of the user as a suffix to the username.

Format for Starburst Enterprise or Trino:
`user.name`
`user.name@mydomain.com`

Format for Starburst Galaxy:
`user.name@mydomain.com/role`

#### Password

This is the password for authentication.

#### DB name

Specify the name of the database that your dbt models are built into. This is the name of a catalog in your cluster.

e.g. `my_postgres_catalog`

#### Port

The port to connect to your cluster. By default, it's 443 for TLS enabled clusters.

e.g. `443`

#### SSL mode

This controls how dbt connects to Trino database using SSL.

#### Start of week

This controls what day is the start of the week in Lightdash. `Auto` sets it to whatever the default is for your data warehouse. Or, you can customize it and select the day of the week from the drop-down menu. This will be taken into account when using 'WEEK' time interval in Lightdash.

## 2. Import a dbt project

---

Connecting Lightdash to a hosted dbt project means that you'll be able to keep your Lightdash instance in sync with the changes in your dbt project.

To connect your dbt project, just head to your project connection settings in Lightdash:

<img
  src={ProjectConnectionSettings}
  width="1043"
  height="613"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Then scroll down to your dbt project connection:

<img
  src={DbtConnectionSettings}
  width="1083"
  height="591"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

Pick your repository type and follow the guide below:

- [GitHub](#github)
- [Gitlab](#gitlab)
- [Azure DevOps](#azure-devops)
- [Bitbucket](#bitbucket)

We don't support connecting Lightdash to [dbt Cloud managed repositories](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-using-a-managed-repository). If you're using dbt Cloud and you'd like to use Lightdash, you'll need to have a remote repository for your dbt project in one of the services listed above.

### GitHub

#### Personal access token

You can create a personal access token (classic), or a fine-grained access token (beta).

##### Personal access token (classic)

This is used to access your repo.
See the [instructions for creating a personal access token here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Select `repo` scope when you're creating the token.

<img
  src={OauthScope}
  width="543"
  height="304"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

##### Fine-grained access token (beta)

Fine-grained access tokens are new special tokens that can only give access to individual repositories on your github account.
You can read more about it on the [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).

1. Go to [settings > Developer access > Personal access tokens > fine-grained token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
2. Add the name, expiration, description and owner (we'll need their username later)
3. Add repository access, you might want to give access only to your `dbt` repository

<img
  src={FineGrainedRepo}
  width="500"
  height="375"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

4. On repository permissions, select `Contents`

<img
  src={FineGrainedPermissions}
  width="800"
  height="91"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

5. Click `Generate token` and copy the token.

You could also replace your old tokens with new fine-grained tokens on project settings.

#### Repository

This should be in the format `my-org/my-repo`. e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics`

#### Branch

This is the branch in your GitHub repo that Lightdash should sync to. e.g. `main`, `master` or `dev`

By default, we've set this to `main` but you can change it to whatever you'd like.

#### Project directory path

This is the folder where your `dbt_project.yml` file is found in the GitHub repository you entered above.

- Put `/` if your `dbt_project.yml` file is in the main folder of your repo (e.g. lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt_project.yml)
- Include the path to the sub-folder where your dbt project is if your dbt project is in a sub-folder in your repo. For example, if my project was in lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt/dbt_project.yml, I'd write `/dbt` in this field.

#### Host domain

If you've [customized the domain for your GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages), you can add the custom domain for your project in here.

By default, this is `github.com`

#### Target name

`target` contains information about your dbt connection to your warehouse.

It's the dataset/schema in your data warehouse that Lightdash will look for your dbt models. By default, we set this to be the same value as you have as the default in your `profiles.yml` file.

If you want to change this to be something other than the default `target` defined in dbt, you can enter the target of your choice here (for example `dbt_khindson`.)

To read more about dbt targets, [check out the dbt docs here.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target)

#### Environment variables

If you've used [environment variables in your dbt `profiles.yml` file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/env_var), you can add these to Lightdash here.

For each environment variable, you'll need to add the `key` + `value` pair for the item.

You'll normally find these values in a file called `.env` in your dbt project directory.

For example, I might have something like:

```yaml
profile:
  target: prod
  outputs:
    prod:
      type: postgres
      host: 127.0.0.1
      user: "{{ env_var('DBT_USER') }}"
      ....
```

Then a `.env` file like:

```
export DBT_USER="myspecialuserkey123"
```

So, in Lightdash, I'd add a new environment variable and put `key` as `DBT_USER` and `value` as `myspecialuserkey123`.

---

### GitLab

#### Personal access token

This is used to access your repo.
See the [instructions for creating a personal access token here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

Select `read_repository` scope when you're creating the token. The token, if using a **project access token**, or the user, when using a **personal access token**, needs to have permission to download the code. Normally this would be the `Reporter` role.

#### Repository

You can find this in the GitLab URL when you're in your repo. This should be in the format `my-org/my-repo`. e.g. if my browser had `https://gitlab.com/lightdash/lightdash-analytics.gitlab.io`, I'd put in: `lightdash/lightdash-analytics` as my repository in Lightdash.

#### Branch

This is the branch in your GitLab repo that Lightdash should sync to. e.g. `main`, `master` or `dev`

By default, we've set this to `main` but you can change it to whatever you'd like.

#### Project directory path

This is the folder where your `dbt_project.yml` file is found in the GitLab repository you entered above.

If your `dbt_project.yml` file is in the main folder of your repo (e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt_project.yml`),
then you don't need to change anything in here. You can just leave the default value we've put in.

If your dbt project is in a sub-folder in your repo (e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt/dbt_project.yml`), then
you'll need to include the path to the sub-folder where your dbt project is (e.g. `/dbt`).

#### Host domain

If you've [customized the domain for your GitLab pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/getting_started_part_one.html), you can add the custom domain for your project in here.

By default, this is `gitlab.io`.

#### Target name

`target` contains information about your dbt connection to your warehouse.

It's the dataset/schema in your data warehouse that Lightdash will look for your dbt models. By default, we set this to be the same value as you have as the default in your `profiles.yml` file.

If you want to change this to be something other than the default `target` defined in dbt, you can enter the target of your choice here (for example `dbt_khindson`.)

To read more about dbt targets, [check out the dbt docs here.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target)

#### Environment variables

If you've used [environment variables in your dbt `profiles.yml` file](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/env_var), you can add these to Lightdash here.

For each environment variable, you'll need to add the `key` + `value` pair for the item.

You'll normally find these values in a file called `.env` in your dbt project directory.

For example, I might have something like:

```yaml
profile:
  target: prod
  outputs:
    prod:
      type: postgres
      host: 127.0.0.1
      user: "{{ env_var('DBT_USER') }}"
      ....
```

Then a `.env` file like:

```
export DBT_USER="myspecialuserkey123"
```

So, in Lightdash, I'd add a new environment variable and put `key` as `DBT_USER` and `value` as `myspecialuserkey123`.

### Azure DevOps

#### Personal access token

This is your secret token used to access Azure Devops. See the [instructions to create a personal access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows)
You must specify at least the Repo:Read scope.

#### Organization

This is the name of the organization that owns your repository

#### Project

This is the name of the project that owns your repository

#### Repository

This is the name of the repository. For many projects, this is the same as your project name above.

#### Branch

This is the branch in your repository that Lightdash should sync to. e.g. `main`, `master` or `dev`

By default, we've set this to `main` but you can change it to whatever you'd like.

#### Project directory path

This is the folder where your `dbt_project.yml` file is found in the repository you entered above.

If your `dbt_project.yml` file is in the main folder of your repo (e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt_project.yml`),
then you don't need to change anything in here. You can just leave the default value we've put in.

If your dbt project is in a sub-folder in your repo (e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt/dbt_project.yml`), then
you'll need to include the path to the sub-folder where your dbt project is (e.g. `/dbt`).

#### Target name

`target` contains information about your dbt connection to your warehouse.

      ....
```

Then a `.env` file like:

```
export DBT_USER="myspecialuserkey123"
```

So, in Lightdash, I'd add a new environment variable and put `key` as `DBT_USER` and `value` as `myspecialuserkey123`.

### Local dbt project

:::caution Prerequisite

Unsuitable for production and only available for Lightdash instances installed on your local machine

:::

To start Lightdash with the option to connect to a local dbt project, you must specify the directory of the dbt project when
you start docker compose:

```shell
# Specify the absolute path to your dbt project
# e.g. export DBT_PROJECT_DIR=/Users/elonmusk/mydbtproject
export DBT_PROJECT_DIR= # Enter your path here!
docker compose start
```

### Bitbucket

#### Username

This is the login name for your Bitbucket user. This is usually the same username you use to login to
Bitbucket. You can find your username in Bitbucket by:

1. Going to your avatar in the bottom left and click **Personal settings**.
2. From the **Account settings** page, check the value next to the **Username**

Alternatively, you can [create a new user through the Bitbucket console](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/users-and-groups-776640439.html)
with a username and password specifically for Lightdash to use.

#### Http access token

Getting a token depends on whether you use Bitbucket Cloud or Bitbucket server:

- Bitbucket Cloud users should [follow instructions for creating an App Password](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-an-app-password/)
- Bitbucket Server users should [follow instructions for creating a HTTP Access Token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/http-access-tokens-939515499.html)

Select `Project read` and `Repository read` scope when you're creating the token.

#### Repository

This should be in the format `my-org/my-repo`. e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics`

#### Branch

This is the branch in your Bitbucket repo that Lightdash should sync to. e.g. `main`, `master` or `dev`

By default, we've set this to `main` but you can change it to whatever you'd like.

#### Project directory path

This is the folder where your `dbt_project.yml` file is found in the Bitbucket repository you entered above.

- Put `/` if your `dbt_project.yml` file is in the main folder of your repo (e.g. lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt_project.yml)
- Include the path to the sub-folder where your dbt project is if your dbt project is in a sub-folder in your repo. For example, if my project was in lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt/dbt_project.yml, I'd write `/dbt` in this field.

#### Host domain

If you've [customized the domain for your Bitbucket server](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/specify-the-bitbucket-base-url-776640392.html), you can add the custom domain for your project in here.

#### Target name

`target` contains information about your dbt connection to your warehouse.

It's the dataset/schema in your data warehouse that Lightdash will look for your dbt models. By default, we set this to be the same value as you have as the default in your `profiles.yml` file.

If you want to change this to be something other than the default `target` defined in dbt, you can enter the target of your choice here (for example `dbt_khindson`.)

To read more about dbt targets, [check out the dbt docs here.](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target)

#### Environment variables

      user: "{{ env_var('DBT_USER') }}"
      ....
```

Then a `.env` file like:

```
export DBT_USER="myspecialuserkey123"
```

So, in Lightdash, I'd add a new environment variable and put `key` as `DBT_USER` and `value` as `myspecialuserkey123`.
