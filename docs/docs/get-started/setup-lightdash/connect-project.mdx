# Connect a project

How you connect your dbt project depends on where it is hosted.

1. If you want to connect a dbt project that's version controlled, take a look at:
   - [how to connect with GitHub](#github)
   - [how to connect with GitLab](#gitlab)
2. If you want to connect to your local dbt project, then you can check [how to connect to local dbt](#local-dbt-project)

Once you've set up the connection to your dbt project, you'll need to continue on to [set up the connection to your warehouse](#warehouse-connection) (it's a short step, we promise 🤞).

We currently support:

1. [Bigquery](#bigquery)
2. [Postgres](#postgres)
3. [Redshift](#redshift)
4. [Snowflake](#snowflake)

If we don't support the warehouse you're using, don't be afraid to reach out to us in [GitHub](https://github.com/lightdash/lightdash)! :)

## dbt connection options

----

### GitHub

#### Personal access token
This is used to access your repo.
See the [instructions for creating a personal access token here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Select `repo` scope when you're creating the token.

![screenshot](../assets/oauth-scope.png)

#### Repository
This should be in the format `my-org/my-repo`. e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics`

#### Branch
This is the branch in your GitHub repo that Lightdash should sync to. e.g. `main`, `master` or `dev`

By default, we've set this to `main` but you can change it to whatever you'd like.

#### Project directory path
This is the folder where your `dbt_project.yml` file is found in the GitHub repository you entered above.

- Put `/` if your `dbt_project.yml` file is in the main folder of your repo (e.g. lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt_project.yml)
- Include the path to the sub-folder where your dbt project is if your dbt project is in a sub-folder in your repo. For example, if my project was in lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt/dbt_project.yml, I'd write `/dbt` in this field.

----

### GitLab

#### Personal access token
This is used to access your repo.
See the [instructions for creating a personal access token here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

Select `read_repository` scope when you're creating the token.

#### Repository
This should be in the format `my-org/my-repo`. e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics`

#### Branch
This is the branch in your GitLab repo that Lightdash should sync to. e.g. `main`, `master` or `dev`

By default, we've set this to `main` but you can change it to whatever you'd like.

#### Project directory path
This is the folder where your `dbt_project.yml` file is found in the GitLab repository you entered above.

If your `dbt_project.yml` file is in the main folder of your repo (e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt_project.yml`),
then you don't need to change anything in here. You can just leave the default value we've put in.

If your dbt project is in a sub-folder in your repo (e.g. `lightdash/lightdash-analytics/dbt/dbt_project.yml`), then
you'll need to include the path to the sub-folder where your dbt project is (e.g. `/dbt`).

----

### Local dbt project

:::caution Prerequisite

If you're using a local dbt project, during the [install process](./install-lightdash.mdx) you should have set the path
to your local dbt project.

:::

####

**Project directory**

This is path to the dbt project inside the docker container.

If you followed the [install instructions](./install-lightdash.mdx), then keep the value as **"/usr/app/dbt"**.
