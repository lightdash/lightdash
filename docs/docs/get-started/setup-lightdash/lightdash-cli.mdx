# Get your dbt project Lightdash-ready

Lightdash connects to your existing dbt project to manage all your data in one place. With dbt you can transform the data in your data warehouse and explore it in Lightdash.

But, before you hook up your dbt project to Lightdash, we want to make sure it's ready for exploring. We'll walk you through the steps of installing + using the Lightdash CLI and generating the .yml you need for your dbt project.

## New to dbt?

If you haven't used dbt before, [follow dbt's getting started guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/setting-up) 
before proceeding with setting up Lightdash.

## Installing the Lightdash CLI tool

The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your dbt + Lightdash project. It makes development faster and
easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash instance.

To install Lightdash, you'll need to have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 
installed. Mac/Linux users usually already have `npm` available (you can check by running `npm` in your command line).

To install the Lightdash CLI, run the following on your command line.

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

Or install a specific version (eg: 0.162.0)

```shell
npm install -g @lightdash/cli@0.162.0
```

You _may_ need to install an additional package if you see any errors:

**Mac OS**


```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" # install homebrew if you don't have it
brew install unixodbc
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

**Ubuntu**

```shell
sudo apt install unixodbc
npm install -g @lightdash/cli
```

## Creating dimensions in Lightdash using `lightdash dbt run`

Dimensions are attributes of your data. They are directly linked to a column in a dbt model.

To explore data in Lightdash, you need to have dimensions defined in your dbt model properties. Dimensions are created automatically when you define columns in your dbt model properties. 

For example, if I had a dbt .yml file that looked like this:

```yaml
version: 2
models:
  - name: users
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: "unique ID for a user"
      - name: first_name
        description: "User's first name"
```

Then, I'd see a table in Lightdash called `Users` with two dimensions to explore: `User id` and `First name`.

Before you get started with the next steps, you might want to check out onto a new branch if you're working with a version controlled project!

To get our dbt project Lightdash-ready, we need to define all of the columns in our dbt models that we want to explore in Lightdash. We've made this really easy with to do using our CLI tool. 

You have a few options:

### 1. Generate dimensions for my **_entire_** dbt project

To do this, you just need to run the following on your command line:

```shell
lightdash dbt run
```

This command will run + generate the `.yml` files with dimensions for all of the columns for all of the models in your dbt project. 

### 2. Generate dimensions for **_some_** of the models in my dbt project

There may be a specific set of models that you want to start out with in Lightdash. If this is the case, we recommend [using dbt's `tags`](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/tags) to tag these models. You can use sets of existing tags, or you can create a new Lightdash-specific tag. Something like this:

```yaml
{{
  config(
    materialized='table',
    tags=['lightdash']
  )
}}
```

The `lightdash dbt run` command supports dbt model selection syntax to generate .yml files for a group of models. This means you can use tags or other model selection syntax to specify which models you want to generate dimensions for in your dbt project.

```shell
lightdash dbt run -s tag:lightdash # all models with the lightdash tag
lightdash dbt run -s payments  # just payments
lightdash dbt run -s payments+ # payments and all children
lightdash dbt run -s +payments # payments and all parents
lightdash dbt run -s payments+ +customers tag:lightdash # mix and match
```

Now, you should have a bunch of model .yml files filled with dimensions ready to be explored.

## Make sure your changes are in production, then you're ready to go!

If you're working with a version controlled project, you'll just want to make sure to merge your changes into production (e.g. `main` or `master`) before you move onto the next steps. 

Once you've got the model .yml files where you want 'em, you're ready to move onto the next step of connecting your project.
