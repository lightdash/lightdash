# Inviting teammates to your Lightdash project

You can only share things with people you've invited to your Lightdash project. Users with admin access to your project can invite users.

## Allowing users with certain email domain(s) to join automatically

<AllowedEmailDomains />

## Inviting new users individually

To invite your teammates individually, just click on `Settings` --> `User Management` --> `Add user`.

  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You then need to input the email address of the user you want to invite and select the role you want to assign them. You can read more about [user roles and permissions in Lightdash here](../../references/roles.mdx).

Once you hit `send invite`, we'll send an email to the new user with their invite link.

/>

Once you're done inviting users, you can head back to the list of users in the `User Management` tab, scroll to the bottom and see all of the pending invitations for your project. You can also re-generate an invite link if you need to!
