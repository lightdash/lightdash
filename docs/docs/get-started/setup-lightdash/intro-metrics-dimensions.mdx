# An intro to metrics and dimensions

## What are metrics and dimensions?

Metrics and dimensions are defined in your dbt project alongside your dbt model properties.

* **Dimensions** are used to **segment data** in your Tables.
* **Metrics** are used to **perform calculations** on your Tables.

Say we're running an ecommerce business, we probably have a table containing all order data. We might want to
ask:

<img src={DataQuestion} width="1004" height="227" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

This question can be answered using a single metric "the total number of unique orders" and a single dimension for
splitting the metric by "status of order". In Lightdash you'd get the following chart:
