## 3. Choose a chart to add to your dashboard

Charts can only be added to a dashboard if they've been saved. See [instructions for saving charts](./using-explores.mdx) for more
information.

Click "add chart" to see a list of charts that have been saved. Clicking any chart will add it at the top of your
dashboard.
