# Preview Projects

**Preview projects** are temporary Lightdash projects where you can safely experiment with your metrics, dimensions and charts without affecting your production project. 

Preview projects are commonly used to:
- test changes in models, metrics and dimensions.
- make changes to important content in production without any downtime by [promoting the content](/guides/how-to-promote-content) you've changed in your preview project when it's ready.

## Creating a preview project

::: info

Only users who have developer permissions or above in a project can create preview projects.

:::

### In the Lighdash CLI tool

You can use the [Lightdash CLI tool](/guides/cli/how-to-install-the-lightdash-cli) to generate preview projects in Lightdash from your command line. 

```shell
# This will create a preview and will wait until you press a key to delete the preview project
lightdash preview
```

or

```shell
# This will create a preview and exit, you will have to run lightdash stop-preview to delete it
lightdash start-preview
```

You can see more information about the [`lightdash preview` CLI command here](/references/lightdash-cli#lightdash-preview).

### In the Lightdash Application

You can create a preview project in the Lightdash web app by clicking on the projects list, then clicking `+ Create Preview`.

  height="751"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

## Permissions

### Permissions are copied from the parent project

All permissions from the parent project are carried over to the preview project.

For example, there is a project called `Marketing Insights` and Priyanka is a project interactive viewer in it. Irakli is a developer and creates a preview project of `Marketing Insights` called `Marketing Insights Preview`. Irakli creates a chart in `Marketing Insights Preview` and shares it with Priyanka. She can open the chart because she was an interactive viewer in `Marketing Insights`, so her permissions were copied over to `Marketing Insights Preview`. 

::: info

Only users who are developers or admins can see preview projects in the project list. However, users with access to a preview project can open links shared with them from the preview project.

:::

### Only content a user has access to will be copied to the preview project

For the user creating a project, only content they have access to will be copied over to the preview project.

For example, there is a project called `Marketing Insights` and there is a space called `Finance private space`. Irakli is a developer in `Marketing Insights`, but doesn't have access to `Finance private space`. If Irakli creates a preview project of `Marketing Insights`, then the content in `Finance private space` will not be copied over to his preview project (because he doesn't have access to it). 

## Project connection settings 

The project connection settings cannot be changed in a preview project.

### Preview projects created from the CLI

For preview projects created from the CLI, all project connection settings come from your local profiles.yml file.
