# Dimensions reference

Dimensions are the columns in your table. They are the "attributes" of your data. For example, `user_id` in your users table is a dimension.

Dimensions usually match 1:1 with columns in your dbt models (see [additional dimensions](#additional-dimensions) for counterexamples).

---

## Adding dimensions to your project

Read more about [adding dimensions to your project in our docs here](/guides/how-to-create-dimensions).

For a dimension to appear in Lightdash, you just need to declare it in your dbt model's YAML file.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: user_id # will be "User id" in LightDash
        description: 'Unique identifier for a user."
```

## Dimension configuration

To customize the dimension, you can do it in your dbt model's YAML file.

If you want to declare multiple dimensions based on the same column, check [additional dimensions](#additional-dimensions) section.

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    meta:
      group_details:
        finance:
          label: Finance

      joins:
        - join: web_sessions
          sql_on: ${web_sessions.date} = ${sales_stats.date}
    columns:
      - name: revenue_gbp_total_est
        description: 'Total estimated revenue in GBP based on forecasting done by the finance team.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
            label: 'Total revenue' # this is the label you'll see in Lightdash
            description: 'My custom description' # you can override the description you'll see in Lightdash here
            sql: 'IF(${TABLE}.revenue_gbp_total_est = NULL, 0, ${registered_user_email})' # custom SQL applied to the column from dbt used to define the dimension
            hidden: false
            round: 2
            format: 'gbp'
            groups: ['finance']

              type: number
              label: 'Day of Week'
              sql: 'day_of_week(${date})'
            dimension_name_two:
              type: boolean
              label: 'Weekday or Weekend'
              sql: "case when day_of_week(${date}) < 5 then 'weekday' else 'weekend' end"
```

## Type

The types of your dimensions are pulled from your data warehouse, automatically. You can override these types using the `type` meta tag in your .yml file. If you run `lightdash generate` to generate your .yml files, then Lightdash will add the `type` from your data warehouse to your .yml files automatically.

```yaml
- name: user_created_date
  meta:
    dimension:
      type: date
```

We currently support these dimension types:

| Dimension Types |
| --------------- |
| string          |
| number          |
| timestamp       |
| date            |
| boolean         |

## Description

Column descriptions in your YAML file are automatically pulled into Lightdash and you can spot them if you hover over the dimension name 👀

![screenshot-column-descriptions](assets/screenshot-column-descriptions.png)

Descriptions support any formatting that works with YAML, but the three characters used most often are:

### Quotes for escaping

When you surround text with double or single quotes it will escape the text between so that any special characters recognized by YAML will still pass through to the Lightdash UI.

```yaml
description: 'The contents of this column include this & that.'
```

### Greater than symbol for folded text blocks

When you use `>-` it allows you to type descriptions that are multiple lines long in the YAML file, but the text will be combined into a single line when parsed. The `lightdash generate` command will automatically add this to keep YAML files easy to read.

This description in YAML:

```yaml
- name: product_tier
  description: >-
    This is a longer description...
    ...that requires multiple lines
    and it will be combined in the Lightdash UI
```

Will appear like this in the Lightdash UI:

```
This is a longer description......that requires multiple lines and it will be combined in the Lightdash UI
```

### Vertical bar for preserving line breaks

If you need line breaks to stay in place when they show up in the Lightdash UI, you can use a `|` character like this:

```yaml
- name: product_tier
  description: |
    This is a longer description...
    ...that requires multiple lines
    and it will stay on multiple lines
```

And in Lightdash UI it will appear like this:

```
This is a longer description...
...that requires multiple lines
and it will stay on multiple lines
```

### Using dbt doc blocks

You can also use dbt docs blocks in descriptions, [more on that here](/guides/cli/how-to-auto-generate-schema-files#using-doc-blocks-to-build-better-yml-files).

## Compact values

You can compact values in your YAML. For example, if I wanted all of my revenue values to be shown in thousands (e.g. `1,500` appears as `1.50K`), then I would write something like this in my .yml:

```yaml
	version: 2
	models:
	- name: sales
	  columns:
	    - name: revenue
	      meta:
	        dimension:
	            compact: thousands # You can also use 'K'
```

| Value     | Alias              | Example output |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| thousands | "K" and "thousand" | 1K             |
| millions  | "M" and "million"  | 1M             |
| billions  | "B" and "billion"  | 1B             |
| trillions | "T" and "trillion" | 1T             |

## Time intervals

Lightdash automatically adds intervals for dimensions that are timestamps or dates, so you don't have to!

For example, here we have the timestamp dimension `created` defined in our dbt project:

```yaml
- name: created
  description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
```

Lightdash breaks this out into the default intervals automatically. So, this is how `created` appears in our Lightdash project:

![screenshot-default-intervals](assets/screenshot-default-intervals.png)

### By default, the time intervals we use are:

**Date**: ['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR']

**Timestamp**: ['RAW', 'DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR']

### To turn off time intervals for a dimension, set `time_intervals: OFF`

If you want to turn off time intervals for a dimension, you can simply set the `time_intervals` property to `OFF`.

In this example, `created` would now appear as a single, timestamp dimension without a drop-down list of time intervals in Lightdash:

```yaml
- name: created
  description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
  meta:
    dimension:
      time_intervals: OFF
```

![screenshot-intervals-off](assets/screenshot-intervals-off.png)

### To customize the time intervals for a dimension, you can use the `time_intervals` parameter.

If you specify time intervals manually, then this overrides the default time intervals used by Lightdash.

```yaml
- name: created
  description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
  meta:
    dimension:
      time_intervals: ['DAY', 'WEEK', 'MONTH', 'YEAR', 'QUARTER']
```

You can see all of the interval options for date and timestamp fields below.

### Date options

| QUARTER_NAME     | Quarter name    | String | Q3              |

## Format

You can use the `format` parameter to have your dimensions show in a particular format in Lightdash.

```yaml
- name: revenue
  description: 'Timestamp when the user was created.'
  meta:
    dimension:
      format: 'usd'
    metrics:
      total_revenue:
        type: sum
        format: 'usd'
```

These are the options:

| Option  | Description                                                                         | Raw value  | Displayed value |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| km      | Adds the suffix `km` to your value                                                  | 10         | 10 km           |
| mi      | Adds the suffix `mile` to your value                                                | 10         | 10 mi           |
| usd     | Adds the `$` symbol to your number value                                            | 10         | $10.00          |
| gbp     | Adds the `£` symbol to your number value                                            | 10         | £10.00          |
| eur     | Adds the `€` symbol to your number value                                            | 10         | €10.00          |
| percent | Adds the `%` symbol and multiplies your value by 100                                | 0.1        | %10             |
| id      | Removes commas and spaces from number or string types so that they appear like IDs. | 12,389,572 | 12389572        |

## Groups

You can group your dimensions and metrics in the sidebar using the `groups` parameter.

To do this, you need to set up `group_details` in the model's configuration. Then, you can use these groups to organize metrics and dimensions. You can create nested groups up to 3 levels.

```yaml
version: 2
models:
  - name: baskets
    meta:
      group_details:
        product_details:
          label: Product Details
          description: 'Fields that have information about the products in the basket.'
        item_details:
          label: Item Details
          description: 'Fields that have information about the items in the basket.'

    columns:
      - name: basket_item_id
        description: 'ID for the product item within the basket.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            groups: ['product_details', 'item_details'] # this would add the dimension to a nested group: `product details` --> `item details`
      - name: product_name
        description: 'Full name of the product.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            label: 'Product name'
            groups: ['product_details'] # this would add the dimension under the group label: `product_details`
```

This example would look like this in the sidebar:

<img
  src={Groups}
  width="412"
  height="650"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

## URLs

Lightdash users can interact with dimension values by clicking on them. By adding custom `urls` you can configure
the actions available to your users. Like linking to external tools, or taking actions in other tools.

<img
  src={ClickableDimension}
  width="583"
  height="274"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

In the example below, users can click on a company name and open a corresponding record in their CRM or search for
the company in google or open that company's Slack channel.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: company_name
    label: Registered trading name of the company
    meta:
      dimension:
        urls:
          - label: Search for company in Google
            url: 'https://google.com/search?${ value.formatted | url_encode }'
          - label: Open in CRM
            url: 'https://mycrm.com/companies/${ row.company.company_id.raw | url_encode }'
```

The `${ value.formatted }` will be replaced with the value of the company name in the Lightdash UI at query run time.
The `${ row.company.company_id.raw }` will be replaced with the value of the company id in the Lightdash UI at query run time.
The action will be disabled if the column "company_id" from table "company" is not part of the query.

### You can reference values from other columns in your URLs

You can reference another dimension from your table in your URL. For these URLs to work, the other column you've referenced needs to be included in your results table.
For example, say I’ve added a URL to `company_name` and it uses the field `customer_id`:

```
columns:
  - name: company_name
    label: Registered trading name of the company
    meta:
      dimension:
        urls:
          - label: "Open company"
            url: "https://example.com/company/${row.customers.customer_id.raw | url_encode }"
```

This URL will only work if I have `customer_id` included in my results table.

### Liquid Templating

Use templates to configure the url values depending on the query, this allows your urls to depend on the results of queries.

**Available liquid tags**

| Tag                                         | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `${ value.formatted }`                      | The exact value of the dimension as seen in the Lightdash UI. For example "$1,427.20"        |
| `${ value.raw }`                            | The raw value of the dimension returned from the underlying SQL query. For example "1427.2 " |
| `${ row.table_name.column_name.formatted }` | The exact value of the column as seen in the Lightdash UI. For example "$1,427.20"           |
| `${ row.table_name.column_name.raw }`       | The raw value of the dimension returned from the underlying SQL query. For example "1427.2 " |

**Available liquid filters**

Filters can be used to make small transformations of your values:

| Filter     | Description                                                            | Example usage         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| url_encode | Encode a string as url safe, for example it replaces spaces with `%20` | `${value.formatted \  | url_encode }`     |
| downcase   | Convert string to all lowercase                                        | `${value.formatted \  | downcase }`       |
| append     | Append a string to another                                             | `${value.formatted \  | append: ".html"}` |

There are [many more filters available in the Liquid documentation](https://liquidjs.com/filters/overview.html).

## Required attributes

Lightdash can use `user attributes` to limit some dimensions to some users.

In the example below, only users with `is_admin` attribute `true` can use the `salary` dimension on `user` table. Users without access to this dimension will not see it or the custom metrics created from this dimension on the `explore page`.

```
columns:
  - name:
    description: User name
  - salary:
    description: User salary
    meta:
      dimension:
        required_attributes:
          is_admin: "true"
```

If a user without access to this dimension runs a query that contains this dimension, they will get a `Forbidden` error.

### Current limitations

Lightdash dimensions and custom metrics are protected by this feature, however,
it is possible to write custom SQL to bypass this filter, for example:

- Developers and admins running SQL queries on SQL runner.
- Custom SQL or subqueries on `table calculations`

:::info

Scheduler deliveries will run against the user who created the scheduled delivery, be careful when sharing required attributes with other users.

:::

## Colors

You can predefine colors for your string type dimensions, these colors will be used instead of your default organization colors for the right value when you use
a grouped bar chart or a pie chart.

```
  - name: status
    description: "{{ doc(\"orders_status\") }}"
    meta:
      dimension:
        colors:
          "placed": "#e6fa0f"
          "completed": "#558B2F"
          "shipped": "#29B6F6"
          "return_pending": "#FF6F00"
          "returned": "#E91E63"
```

<img
  src={PieChartColor}
  width="583"
  height="274"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

:::info

We recommend using #HEX colors, other color types like rgba,rgba or color name (eg: orange) are also supported on charts, but they are not yet supported on the chart config.

:::

:::info

You can manually override these dimension colors by going into the chart config and
manually picking a color for that serie.

These colors will also take precedence over the organization color palette.

:::

## Using special characters or capital letters in your column names

If you use special characters on your column names, you might get errors when using those columns on explore.
For example, having a column named `Status` with capital S on a table named `orders` in postgres throws the following error:

```
column orders.status does not exist
```

To fix this, we can add the quoted column to our `sql` meta tag on dimensions

```
- name: status
  meta:
    dimension:
      type: string
      sql: '"orders"."Status"' # you can also use '${TABLE}."Status"'

```

This will quote the `Status` columns on the SQL query

```
SELECT
  "orders".order_id AS "orders_order_id",
  "orders"."Status" AS "orders_status"
FROM "postgres"."jaffle"."orders" AS "orders"
```

## Additional dimensions

Additional dimensions let you define multiple dimensions off of a single column from your dbt model. This is useful when [adding different formatting](#adding-different-formatting) to a column, [comparing or combining columns](#comparing-or-combining-columns), [parsing JSON
columns](#parsing-json-columns), or creating persisted groups/buckets based off of a column.

A "normal" dimension is a column created in your .sql file in dbt that is written to your data warehouse.
An additional dimension is not included in your dbt .sql file, so it's not written to your data warehouse. When used in Lightdash, it just adds the dimension definition to your SQL query (so it's "created" at runtime).

All [dimension configurations](#dimension-configuration) are available for additional dimensions. You can also [use additional dimensions when defining metrics](#using-additional-dimensions-in-metrics).

:::info

Additional dimensions names need to be unique in the model.

:::

### Adding different formatting

```yaml
columns:
  - name: revenue
    meta:
      dimension:
        type: number
      additional_dimensions:
        revenue_in_thousands:
          type: number
          compact: thousands
        revenue_in_millions:
          type: number
          compact: million
```

### Comparing or combining columns

When defining additional dimensions, you can reference other dimensions, even from joined tables (`organizations` is a joined table in the example below).

```yaml
columns:
  - name: created_date
    meta:
      dimension:
        type: date
      additional_dimensions:
        days_to_first_query_run:
          type: number
          description: 'Number of days between a user being created and their first query run.'
          sql: ${first_query_date} - ${created_date}
        days_to_organization_first_payment:
          type: number
          description: 'Number of days between a user being created and their organization making its first payment. This will be negative for users who joined after the first payment.'
          sql: ${created_date} - ${organizations.first_payment_date}
```

### Parsing JSON columns

Usually you'll want to add `hidden:true` for the main JSON dimension since raw JSON is not useful in charts.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: metadata # this is a jsonb column with metadata
    meta:
      dimension:
        hidden: true
      additional_dimensions:
        version:
          type: number
          sql: JSON_VALUE(${metadata}, '$.version') # custom SQL applied to get the "version" value inside metadata
```

### Adding multiple timezones for the same dimension

You can use additional dimensions to convert a timestamp into multiple timezones:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: created_at
    description: 'The time that the thing was created'
    meta:
      dimension:
        label: 'Created (UTC)'
        type: timestamp
      additional_dimensions:
        created_at_est:
          type: timestamp
          label: 'Created (EST)'
          description: 'The time that the thing was created, in EST'
          sql: "convert_timezone('UTC', 'America/New_York', ${TABLE}.created_at)"
```

### Using additional dimensions in metrics

To define metrics based on additional dimensions, you need to add them to the model's meta metrics, or use custom SQL in
defining them under the column's meta.

```yaml
models:
  - name: users
    meta:
      metrics:
        highest_version_model_metric_example:
          type: max
          sql: ${version}
    columns:
      - name: metadata
        meta:
          dimension:
            hidden: true
          additional_dimensions:
            version:
              type: number
              sql: JSON_VALUE(${metadata}, '$.version')
          metrics:
            highest_version:
              type: max
              sql: ${version}
```
