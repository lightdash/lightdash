# dbt Semantic Layer

You can use Lightdash to explore the semantic models you've defined in [dbt's Semantic Layer](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer). 

Note that this integration is **_separate_** to the Lightdash Semantic Layer (which is configured in your dbt project under the `meta` tags in your .yml files).
