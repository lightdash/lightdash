# dbt Semantic Layer

You can use Lightdash to explore the semantic models you've defined in [dbt's Semantic Layer](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer). 

Note that this integration is **_separate_** to the Lightdash Semantic Layer (which is configured in your dbt project under the `meta` tags in your .yml files).

:::info

[dbt Semantic Layer](https://www.getdbt.com/product/semantic-layer) is a dbt Cloud product. To use dbt Semantic Layer, you **need to have a dbt Cloud account and [have the dbt Semantic Layer configured](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/sl-snowflake-qs?step=14)** in your dbt Cloud project.

## Connect Lightdash to your dbt Semantic Layer

Before you can connect your dbt Semantic Layer to Lightdash, you need to:

- have an active dbt Cloud (i.e. paid dbt) account. 
- [have the dbt Semantic Layer configured](https://docs.getdbt.com/guides/sl-snowflake-qs?step=14)** in on of your dbt Cloud projects.

### Go to the `Semantic Layer Integrations` page in your `Project connection settings`

### Service token

This is a service token for your dbt Cloud account. To generate a service token:

1. Go to https://cloud.getdbt.com/next/settings
2. From the sidebar, click on `API tokens` --> `service tokens`, then `create new token`
3. Give your token at least `Semantic Layer Only` permissions and select the project where you've [configured the dbt Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl#set-up-dbt-semantic-layer).
4. Choose the Semantic Layer Credentials that you want to give to the token. 
5. Hit `save`

Copy-paste the token that you've created into `Service Token` on the Semantic Layer integration page in Lightdash.

### Domain

Select the domain where you dbt Cloud instance is being hosted. 

### Environment

The unique identifier for the dbt production environment. This should match the environment that you selected when you [configured your project with the dbt Semantic Layer](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-dbt-semantic-layer/setup-sl#1-select-environment).

You can get this from the dbt Cloud URL when you navigate to `Environments` under `Deploy`. If your URL ends with .../environments/222222, your environmentId is 222222.
