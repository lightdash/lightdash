# SQL Runner

The SQL runner is used to build ad-hoc queries or charts using totally custom SQL. 

A query built in the SQL runner can be:

- used to power a single saved chart
- created into a virtual view 
- written back to dbt as a model

Only users with [`developer` or `admin` access](/references/roles) can use the SQL runner.

## Getting started with the SQL runner

The SQL runner can be accessed from the `new` --> `Query using SQL runner` option in your navigation bar.

/>

Once you're in the SQL runner, you'll see four key components:

1. A list of tables in your data warehouse that Lightdash has access to (based on your data warehouse connection in Lightdash).
2. The schema of a selected table.
3. The SQL query builder. 
4. The results from your latest SQL query.

## Sharing a chart from the SQL runner

Once you've created your chart, you're able to share it either by:

1. Sharing the link in the browser
2. Sharing the link from the `copy link` button

  height="646"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

It is not possible to save a chart from the SQL runner or add it to a dashboard.
