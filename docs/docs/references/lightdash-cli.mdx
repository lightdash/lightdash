# Lightdash CLI reference

The Lightdash CLI is the recommended way to develop your Lightdash project. It makes development faster and easier, as well as giving you options for building more powerful automation to manage your Lightdash projects.

## Global Options

There are two global options that can be used with any command: [version](#version) and [help](#help).


### Version

`--version` or `-V`

Ignores the preceding command and shows the installed CLI version. Usually it's used right after `lightdash`, like one of these:

```console
lightdash --version
lightdash -V
```


### Help

`--help` or `-h`

Tells you what the preceding command does and lists all command-specific options. You can also view the general Lightdash CLI help like this:

```console
lightdash --help
lightdash -h
```

Both return:

When you use the `--help` or `-h` option with a specific command it'll look like this:

```console
lightdash validate --help
```
