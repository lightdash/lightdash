## Summary

This document describes the steps required to integrate Azure or Okta SCIM protocol into your Lightdash Cloud or Enterprise instance. This provides a connection for Azure or Okta to manage users and groups within your organization.

## SCIM Setup within Lightdash

1. Sign into your Lightdash instance, click your initials at the top-right, and select **User Settings**.
2. In the sidebar, select **SCIM Access Tokens**.
3. Click **Generate new token**.
   - Give it a name and an optional expiration date.
   - Once generated, copy and save it in a safe place, as it cannot be viewed again once the modal is closed.
4. Note: Now you will also be able to see your SCIM URL at the top of the page. You will need this when connecting an external SCIM service, such as Okta or Azure.

## Okta Integration
