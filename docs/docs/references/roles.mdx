# Roles and permissions

## Roles in your Lightdash instance

- Everybody in your organization will join as an `Organization Member` unless specified. For example, if I invite someone to a project as an editor, they will become an organization member with `editor` access to that project. If I invite someone to the **_organization_** as a `viewer`, then they will be an `organization viewer` (instead of an `organization member`).
- All organization members can create their own projects and will be the Project Admin for that project.
- Admins have access to all content (even content they haven't been explicitly invited to).

### Project Roles

Project Admins can invite users to their project and assign users or [groups](/references/groups.mdx) to roles in that project. Note that projects may also be
accessible by users with organization roles.

### Organization Roles

Organization Admins can assign roles to organization members, which gives access to all projects in the organization.

:::info

<a name="project-previews" class="hidden-anchor"></a>
Project previews created by Developers, Editors or Interactive Viewers will only
copy spaces/charts/dashboards from the source project they have access to.

:::

### Space Roles

There are three space roles: `Full Access`, `Can Edit`, `Can View`

Users with `Full Access` to a space can restrict and increase a user’s inherited project permissions in a space (e.g. you can make project editors into `can view` in a space). Space permissions determine which users can edit space contents (charts and dashboards), view the contents in a space, and change a space's settings:

- A user needs to have at least the `Can view` access level to a space to see that the space exists and to see the charts and dashboards inside it.
- A user needs to have the `Can edit` access level to a space to edit the content in the space (add/delete/rename charts and dashboards).
- A user needs to have the `Full access` access level to a space to manage access to the space and to edit the space details (name, description, etc.).

Space permissions don't otherwise control what users can do, or which data they can use to build their own content.

This means:

- a project viewer who has `Can edit` space permissions cannot get access to build or edit charts because Viewers don't have access to the Explore view
- an interactive viewer who is given `Can edit` space permissions can save content in that space but not in any other space (unless given `edit` access to another space)
- an editor who is given `Can view` space permissions cannot edit the content in that space, but they can create/edit content in other parts of the project (unless they're given `Can view` access).

| Action               | Full Access | Can Edit | Can View |
| :------------------- | :---------: | :------: | :------: |
| View space content   |     ✅      |    ✅    |    ✅    |
| Manage space content |     ✅      |    ✅    |    ❌    |
| Manage space access  |     ✅      |    ❌    |    ❌    |
| Manage space details |     ✅      |    ❌    |    ❌    |
