# Roles and permissions

## Roles in your Lightdash instance

* Everybody in your organization will join as an `Organization Member` unless specified. For example, if I invite someone to a project as an editor, they will become an organization member with `editor` access to that project. If I invite someone to the **_organization_** as a `viewer`, then they will be an `organization viewer` (instead of an `organization member`).
* All organization members can create their own projects and will be the Project Admin for that project.
* Admins have access to all content (even content they haven't been explicitly invited to).

### Project Roles

Project Admins can invite users to their project and assign users or [groups](/references/groups.mdx) to roles in that project. Note that projects may also be
accessible by users with organization roles.

### Organization Roles

Organization Admins can assign roles to organization members, which gives access to all projects in the organization.
