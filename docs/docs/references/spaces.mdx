# Spaces

Once you've used Lightdash for a while, your team will probably end up with a lot of saved charts and dashboards. Spaces let you organize your saved charts and dashboards.

They're kind of like folders except you can't put a Space inside of a Space (no nesting üê•). All saved chart and dashboards exist in a Space and can only be in one Space at a time.

<img
  src={Spaces}

  height="539"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

To access Spaces, you can either select a Space from the drop-down list in `Browse` or you can click on the Lightdash icon and select your Space from the homepage.

<img
  src={AccessSpaces}
  width="426"
  height="246"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

## Moving items between Spaces

To move a saved chart or dashboard between Spaces, you can click on the three dot menu (`...`) to the right of the item and pick the `Move to Space` action.

<img
  src={MoveBetweenSpace}
  width="1005"
  height="351"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You can also add items to a Space from within the Space. Just click on the `Add` button by the saved charts or the dashboards section of the page. If you select an item that's in another Space, it will get moved to the Space you're adding it to.

<img
  src={AddWithinSpace}
  width="812"
  height="564"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You select multiple items to add at the same time to your Space.

<img
  src={AddModal}
  width="530"
  height="247"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

## Updating and deleting Spaces

You can rename or delete your Space on the homescreen by clicking on the three-dot menu (`...`) for the Space.

<img
  src={RenameDeleteSpace}
  width="892"
  height="258"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

:::warning

Deleting a Space will delete all of the content in that Space.

## Managing access to a Space

By default, when you create a Space, it is restricted so only you can access it. You can edit a Space to make it Restricted Access or Public Access.

To edit access to a Space, navigate into the Space, then click the `share` button. From there, you can choose to make a space `Restricted Access` or `Public Access`.

<img
  src={EditSpaceAccess}
  width="1611"
  height="397"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

By default, in public spaces, a user's space permissions are inherited from their project permissions. For example, if I'm a project viewer, I will get `Can View` access to a Space.

There are three space roles: `Full Access`, `Can Edit`, `Can View`

For more details about actions you can take in a Space based on your role, [check out this table](/references/roles.mdx#space-roles).

### Restricted Access Spaces

**Only admins and members that are invited to a Space with Restricted Access have access to it.**

For example, here I have a Space with Restricted Access. Only admins and the invited members have access to this Space. Katie, Filipe and Marshall have inherited `Full Access` because they are organization admins. Priyanka was invited to the space, so she has `Can View` access to the space. No one else in Lightdash can see or interact with the content in this Space unless they're invited or become an admin.

Only users with `Full Access` permissions to a Restricted Space can invite other users to that Space.

<img
  src={RestrictedAccessSpace}
  width="1292"
  height="495"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

### Public Spaces

**Everyone who has access to your project has access to a Public space.**

For example, here I have a Space with Public access. Everyone who has access to my Project, "Lightdash analytics", will get access to the content in my public space.

<img
  src={PublicAccessSpace}
  width="506"
  height="313"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

**By default, you inherit your space permissions in a public space from your project permissions.**

So, if someone is an `editor` in my project, they will have `Can Edit` permissions in my Space. If someone is a `viewer` in my project, they will have `Can View` permissions in my Space. For more details about actions you can take in a Space based on your role, [check out this table](/references/roles.mdx#space-roles).

**Users with Full Access to the space can change a user's space permissions.**

In Public spaces (just like in restricted spaces), users who have `Full Access` to the space can change other users' space permissions (except admins). Users cannot be removed from Public Spaces. To make a user have `no access` to a space, you must change the space from Public to Restricted.
