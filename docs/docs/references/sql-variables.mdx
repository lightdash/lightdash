# SQL Variables

When writing SQL in your Lightdash models, you can use the following references to template you SQL and make it more
reusable

- `${field}` - reference a field in the current model
- `${model.field}` - reference a field in another model
- `${TABLE}` - reference the current table's sql reference
- `${lightdash.attributes.my_attr_1}` - a user attribute called `my_attr_1`
  - (optional) `ld` as an alias for `lightdash`
  - (optional) `attribute` or `attr` as an alias for `attributes`
- `${lightdash.user.<intrinsic_attribute>}` - reference an `intrinsic_attribute` of the current Lightdash user
  - (optional) `ld` as an alias for `lightdash`
  - available intrinsic user attributes:
    - `email`

:::info

There are cases when the user can get the following error:
"Missing user attribute "email" on sql_filter ..."
```

models:
- name: example
  meta:
    sql_filter: ${lightdash.user.email} = 'example@lightdash.com'

```
The user email is only available if it is verified.
This is a security measure to prevent users from creating/updating an account with any email they don't own and gain access to data they shouldn't see.

If you are self hosting you can enable SMTP or SSO authentication to allow users to verify their email address.
