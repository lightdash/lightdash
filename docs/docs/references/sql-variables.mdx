# SQL Variables

When writing SQL in your Lightdash models, you can use the following references to template you SQL and make it more
reusable

- `${field}` - reference a field in the current model
- `${model.field}` - reference a field in another model
- `${TABLE}` - reference the current table's sql reference
- `${lightdash.attributes.my_attr_1}` - a user attribute called `my_attr_1`
  - (optional) `ld` as an alias for `lightdash`
  - (optional) `attribute` or `attr` as an alias for `attributes`
- `${lightdash.user.<intrinsic_attribute>}` - reference an `intrinsic_attribute` of the current Lightdash user
  - (optional) `ld` as an alias for `lightdash`
  - available intrinsic user attributes:
    - `email`

:::info

The user email attribute is only available when the email is verified.
This is a security measure to prevent users from creating/updating an account with any email they don't own and gain access to data they shouldn't see.

If the user email is not verified you will get the following error:

<img src={MissingAttributeEmailError} style={{ margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }} />

```yaml
models:
  - name: example
    meta:
      sql_filter: ${lightdash.user.email} = 'example@lightdash.com'
```

If you are self hosting you can enable [SMTP](/self-host/customize-deployment/configure-smtp-for-lightdash-email-notifications) or [SSO](/self-host/customize-deployment/use-sso-login-for-self-hosted-lightdash) authentication to allow users to verify their email address.
