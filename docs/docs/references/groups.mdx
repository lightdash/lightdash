# Groups

Groups are a way to manage access to multiple users at the same time. A single user can belong to multiple groups. If a user belongs to multiple groups, the user will inherit all of the permissions granted from the different groups. 

To view and manage your groups, go to the `Organization Settings` > `Users & groups` tab. Only users with an `organization admin` role can manage groups.

## Creating groups

To create a new group, go to `Organization Settings` > `Users & groups` > `Add group`. You can name your group and add users in your organization to the group. By default, newly created groups don’t have access to anything.

## Editing groups

To edit a group, click on the edit button to the right of a group in the list. You can add or remove users from a group and change the group name.

To remove someone from that group, click on the `x` to the right of the group member.

## Deleting groups

To delete a group, click the delete icon to the right of a group in the list to remove it.

## Adding roles to groups

To assign a role to a group, use the `Project access` page in the `Organization settings` menu. From there, you can assign a group or groups to a role which determines their access to the project. For more information, see the [Project roles](/references/roles.mdx#project-roles) page.
