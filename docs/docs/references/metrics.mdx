# Metrics reference

A metric is a value that describes or summarizes features from a collection of data points.
For example, `Num unique user ids` is a metric. It describes the unique number of `user_id`s in a collection of `user_id` data points.

In Lightdash, metrics are used to summarize dimensions or, sometimes, other metrics.

---

## Adding metrics to your project using the `meta` tag.

### 1. Using the column `meta` tag (Suggested)

To add a metric to Lightdash using the `meta` tag, you define it in your dbt project under the dimension name you're trying to describe/summarize.

```version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: user_id # dimension name of your metric
        meta:
          metrics:
            num_unique_user_ids: # name of your metric
              type: count_distinct # metric type
            num_user_ids:
              type: count
```

Once you've got the hang of what these metrics look like, read more about the [metric types you can use below.](#metric-types)

### 2. Using the model `meta` tag

Sometimes a metric references many columns, in these cases you can define the metric at the model level:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    meta:
      metrics:
        num_unique_user_ids:
          type: count_distinct
          sql: ${TABLE}.user_id
```

## Metric Categories

Each metric type falls into one of these categories. The metric categories tell you whether the metric type is an aggregation and what type of fields the metric can reference:

### Aggregate metrics

Aggregate metric types perform (surprise, surprise) aggregations. Sums and averages are examples of aggregate metrics: they are measurements summarizing a collection of data points.

Aggregate metrics can _only_ reference dimensions, not other metrics.

### Non-aggregate metrics

Non-aggregate metrics are metric types that, you guessed it, do _not_ perform aggregations.

Numbers and booleans are examples of non-aggregate metrics. These metric types perform a calculation on a single data point, so they can only reference aggregate metrics. They _cannot_ reference dimensions.

## Metric configuration

You can customize your metrics in your dbt model's YAML file. Here's an example of the properties used in defining a metric:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: web_sessions
          sql_on: ${web_sessions.date} = ${sales_stats.date}
      group_details:
        product_details:
          label: Product Details
          description: 'Fields that have information about the products in the basket.'
        item_details:
          label: Item Details
          description: 'Fields that have information about the items in the basket.'
    columns:
      - name: revenue
        description: 'Total estimated revenue in GBP based on forecasting done by the finance team.'
        meta:
          metrics:
            total_revenue:
              label: 'Total revenue GBP'
              type: SUM
              description: 'Total revenue in GBP'
              sql: 'IF(${revenue} IS NULL, 10, ${revenue})'
              groups: ['product_details', 'item_details'] # this would add the metric to a nested group: `product details` --> `item details`
              hidden: false
              round: 0
              format: 'gbp'
              show_underlying_values:
                - revenue
                - forecast_date
                - web_sessions.session_id # field from joined table
              filters:
                - is_adjusted: true
```

Here are all of the properties you can customize:

| Property                                            | Required | Value                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### percentile

Takes the percentile of the values in the given field. Like SQL's `PERCENTILE_CONT` function.

The `percentile` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-sql-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `median_price` by taking the 50% percentile of the `item_price` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        median_price:
          type: percentile
          percentile: 50
```

### median

Takes the 50th percentile of the values in the given field. Like SQL's `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` function.

The `median` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `median_price` by taking the 50% percentile of the `item_price` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        median_price:
          type: median
```

### average

Takes the average (mean) of the values in the given field. Like SQL's `AVG` function.

The `average` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `avg_price` by taking the average of the `item_price` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        avg_price:
          type: average
```

### boolean

Tells you whether something is True or False.

The `boolean` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a `TRUE` or `FALSE` value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics _or_ [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `boolean` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

`boolean` metrics don't do any aggregations; they just reference other aggregations.

For example, the `avg_price` metric below is an average of all of the `item_price` values in our product table. A second metric called `is_avg_price_above_20` is a `boolean` type metric. The `is_avg_price_above_20` metric has a custom SQL expression that tells us whether the `avg_price` value is greater than 20.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        avg_price:
          type: average
        is_avg_price_above_20:
          type: boolean
          sql: 'IF(${avg_price} > 20, TRUE, FALSE)'
```

### count

Does a table count, like SQL’s `COUNT` function.

The `count` metric can be used on any dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a set of values.

For example, this creates a metric `number_of_users` by counting the number of `user_id` values in the table:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: user_id
    meta:
      metrics:
        number_of_users:
          type: count
```

### count_distinct

Counts the number of distinct values in a given field. It's like SQL’s `COUNT DISTINCT` function.

The `count_distinct` metric can be used on any dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a set of values.

For example, this creates a metric `number_of_unique_users` by counting the number of unique `user_id` values in the table:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: user_id
    meta:
      metrics:
        number_of_unique_users:
          type: count_distinct
```

### date

Gives you a date value from an expression.

The `date` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a date value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics _or_ [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `date` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

**Creating a max or min date metric with `type: date`**

If you want to create a metric of a maximum or minimum date, you can't use `type: max` or of `type: min` metrics because these are only compatible with numeric type fields. Instead, you can calculate a maximum or minimum date by defining a metric of `type: date` and using some custom sql, like this:

```yaml
- name: created_at_date
    meta:
      dimension:
        type: date
      metrics:
        max_created_at_date:
          type: date
          sql: MAX(${TABLE}.created_at_date)
```

### max

Max gives you the largest value in a given numeric field. It's like SQL’s `MAX` function.

The `max` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric value.

Because `type: max` metrics only work with numerical fields, you can't use them to find a maximum date. Instead, you can use the `MAX()` function in the `sql` parameter of a metric of `type: date` to get a maximum date (you can see an [example of this in the `date` section](#date).

For example, this creates a metric `max_delivery_cost` by looking at the `delivery_cost` dimension and taking the largest value it finds:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: delivery_cost
    meta:
      metrics:
        max_delivery_cost:
          type: max
```

### min

Min gives you the smallest value in a given numeric field. It's like SQL’s `MIN` function.

The `min` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric value.

Because `type: min` metrics only work with numerical fields, you can't use them to find a minimum date. Instead, you can use the `MIN()` function in the `sql` parameter of a metric of `type: date` to get a minimum date (you can see an [example of this in the `date` section](#date).

For example, this creates a metric `min_delivery_cost` by looking at the `delivery_cost` dimension and taking the smallest value it finds:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: delivery_cost
    meta:
      metrics:
        min_delivery_cost:
          type: min
```

### number

Used with numbers or integers. A `number` metric doesn't perform any aggregation but can be used to perform simple transformations on other metrics.

The `number` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a numeric or integer value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics _or_ [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `number` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

For example, this creates a metric called `total_gross_profit_margin_percentage` based on the `total_sale_price` and `total_gross_profit_margin` aggregate metrics:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: sale_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        total_sale_price:
          type: sum
  - name: gross_profit_margin
    meta:
      metrics:
        total_gross_profit_margin:
          type: sum
        total_gross_profit_margin_percentage:
          type: number
          sql: '(${total_gross_profit_margin}/ NULLIF(${total_sale_price},0))'
```

The example above also uses the NULLIF() SQL function to avoid division-by-zero errors.

### sum

Adds up the values in a given field. Like SQL’s `SUM` function.

The `sum` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `total_revenue` by adding up the values in the `revenue` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: revenue
    meta:
      metrics:
        total_revenue:
          type: sum
```

### string

Used with fields that include letters or special characters.

The `string` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a string value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics _or_ [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `string` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

`string` metrics are rarely used because most SQL aggregate functions don't return strings. One common exception is MySQL’s `GROUP_CONCAT` function.

For example, this creates a metric `product_name_group` by combining the unique values of a dimension called `product_name`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: product_name
    meta:
      metrics:
        product_name_group:
          type: string
          sql: 'GROUP_CONCAT(${TABLE}.product_name)'
```

## Adding your own metric descriptions

We add default descriptions to all of the metrics you include in your model. But, you can override these using the description parameter when you define your metric.

```yaml
metrics:
  num_user_ids:
    type: count
    description: 'Total number of user IDs. NOTE: this is NOT counting unique user IDs'
```

## Using custom SQL in aggregate metrics

You can include custom SQL in your metric definition to build more advanced metrics using the sql parameter.
Inside the sql parameter, you can reference any other dimension from the given model and any joined models. You **can’t reference other metrics.**

You can reference dimensions from the same model like this: `sql: "${dimension_in_this_model}"`
Or from joined models like this: `sql: "${other_model.dimension_in_other_model}"`

```yaml
metrics:
  num_unique_7d_web_active_user_ids:
    type: count_distinct # metric type
    sql: 'IF(${is_7d_web_active}, ${user_id}, NULL)'
  num_unique_paid_user_ids:
    type: count_distinct
    sql: 'IF(${subscriptions.is_active}, ${user_id}, NULL)'
```

## Using custom SQL in non-aggregate metrics

In non-aggregate metrics, you can reference any other metric from the given model and any joined models. You **can’t reference other dimensions.**

You can reference metrics from the same model like this: `sql: "${metric_in_this_model}"`
Or from joined models like this: `sql: "${other_model.metric_in_other_model}"`

```yaml
metrics:
  num_unique_users:
    type: count_distinct
  is_num_unique_users_above_100:
    type: boolean
    sql: 'IF(${num_unique_users} > 100, TRUE, FALSE)'
  percentage_user_growth_daily:
    type: number
    sql: '(${num_unique_users} - ${growth_model.num_unique_users_lag_1d}) / NULLIF(${growth_model.num_unique_users_lag_1d}, 0)'
```

## Show underlying values

By default, we show all of the dimensions from the Table when you click `View underlying data`. If you have fields from a joined table included in your results table, then we'll also show you all of the fields from the joined Table.

<img
  src={UnderlyingData}
  width="1103"
  height="580"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto 20px auto' }}
/>

You can limit which dimensions are shown for a field when a user clicks `View underlying data` by adding the list of dimensions to your `.yml` files:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: web_sessions
          sql_on: ${web_sessions.date} = ${sales_stats.date}
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: 'Unique ID for users.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
          metrics:
            count_users:
              type: count_distinct
              show_underlying_values:
                - revenue_gbp_total_est
                - actual_date
                - web_sessions.session_id # field from joined table
```

The list of fields must be made of dimension names (no metrics) from the base table or from any joined tables. To reference a field from a joined table, you just need to prefix the dimension name with the joined table name, like this: `my_joined_table_name.my_dimension`.

The order that the fields are listed in `show_underlying_values` is the order that they'll appear in on the `view underlying data` table.

## Compact values

You can compact values in your YAML. For example, if I wanted all of my revenue values to be shown in thousands (e.g. `1,500` appears as `1.50K`), then I would write something like this in my .yml:

```yaml
	version: 2
	models:
	- name: sales
	  columns:
	    - name: revenue
	      meta:
	        dimension:
	            compact: thousands # You can also use 'K'
```

| Value     | Alias              | Example output |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| thousands | "K" and "thousand" | 1K             |
| millions  | "M" and "million"  | 1M             |
| billions  | "B" and "billion"  | 1B             |
| trillions | "T" and "trillion" | 1T             |

## Groups

You can group your dimensions and metrics in the sidebar using the `groups` parameter.

To do this, you need to set up `group_details` in the model's configuration. Then, you can use these groups to organize metrics and dimensions. You can create nested groups up to 2 levels.

```yaml
version: 2
models:
  - name: baskets
    meta:
      group_details:
        product_details:
          label: Product Details
          description: 'Fields that have information about the products in the basket.'
        item_details:
          label: Item Details
          description: 'Fields that have information about the items in the basket.'

    columns:
      - name: basket_item_id
        description: 'ID for the product item within the basket.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            groups: ['product_details', 'item_details'] # this would add the dimension to a nested group: `product details` --> `item details`
          metrics:
            count_total_basket_items:
              type: count_distinct
              groups: ['product_details', 'item_details'] # this would add the metric to a nested group: `product details` --> `item details`
      - name: product_name
        description: 'Full name of the product.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            label: 'Product name'
            groups: ['product_details'] # this would add the dimension under the group label: `product_details`
          metrics:
            count_total_product_types:
              type: count_distinct
              groups: ['product_details'] # this would add the metric under the group label: `product_details`
```

## Filters

Filters are applied to metrics any time that metric is used in Lightdash. Filters can only be used with [aggregate metric types](#metric-categories).

For example, we could add a filter to our users count to make sure it didn't include user IDs with closed accounts, like this:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: 'Unique ID for users.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
          metrics:
            count_users:
              type: count_distinct
              filters:
                - is_closed_account: false
```

These filters do not appear in the `Filters` tab in the Explore view, instead, they are applied automatically in the SQL query that fetches your results. That means filters added using the `filter` parameter can't be removed in the UI and won't be visible to users unless they look at the SQL query.

:::info

To use special characters such as `%!_>` in your filter value you can either put the value in quotes, or escape special characters with a backslash `\`. For example,
if you wanted to filter for subscription status of `is_subscribed` you can write the metric in one of these ways:

```yaml
filters:
  - subscription_status: 'is_subscribed'
```

```yaml
filters:
  - subscription_status: is\_subscribed
```

### Available filter types

| Type                          | Example (in English)                           | Example (as code)             |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| is                            | User name is equal to katie                    | `user_name: "katie"`          |
| is not                        | User name is not equal to katie                | `user_name: "!katie"`         |
| contains                      | User name contains katie                       | `user_name: "%katie%"`        |
| does not contain              | User name does not contain katie               | `user_name: "!%katie%"`       |
| starts with                   | User name starts with katie                    | `user_name: "katie%"`         |
| ends with                     | User name ends with katie                      | `user_name: "%katie"`         |
| is greater than (number)      | Number of orders is greater than 4             | `num_orders: "> 4"`           |
| in the past (date) (interval) | Date is before x (days / months / years)       | `date: "inThePast 14 months"` |
| in the next (date) (interval) | Date is after x (days / months / years)        | `date: "inTheNext 14 days"`   |
| is greater than or equal to   | Number of orders is greater than or equal to 4 | `num_orders: ">= 4"`          |
| is less than                  | Number of orders is less than 4                | `num_orders: "< 4"`           |
| is less than or equal to      | Number of orders is less than or equal to 4    | `num_orders: "<= 4"`          |
| is null                       | Status is `NULL`                               | `status: "null"`              |
| is not null                   | Status is not `NULL`                           | `status: "!null"`             |
| is [boolean]                  | Is complete is true                            | `is_complete: "true"`         |
| is not [boolean]              | Is complete is false or null                   | `is_complete: "!true"`        |

:::info

To filter a field by a set of given values you can supply them as an array for that field. For example,
if you wanted to filter for orders with order status `completed` or `shipped` you should write the metric like:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: order_id
    meta:
      metrics:
        completed_or_shipped_order_count:
          type: count_distinct
          filters:
            - order_status:
                - completed
                - shipped
```

:::

### If you have many filters in your list, they will be joined using `AND`.

For example:

```yaml
filters:
  - is_closed_account: false
  - is_7d_active: true
```

Would give you logic like `is_closed_account = TRUE AND is_7d_active = FALSE`.

### You can filter using fields from either the base model, or any joined models.

To filter using a field from a joined model, just use the syntax `model_name.field`, like this:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: web_sessions
          sql_on: ${web_sessions.date} = ${sales_stats.date}
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: 'Unique ID for users.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
          metrics:
            count_users:
              type: count_distinct
              filters:
                - is_closed_account: false
                - web_sessions.is_bot_user: false
```

### Metric filters cannot be used with non-aggregate metrics

You can't use filters with non-aggregate metric types. Instead, if your non-aggregate metrics are referencing aggregate metric types, you need to apply metric filters to the aggregate metrics.

Here's an example: imagine you wanted to calculate the average cost per item that had the status `shipped`. You would need to do something like this in your .yml:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: orders
    meta:
      metrics:
        average_cost_per_item_shipped:
          type: number
          sql: ${total_cost_of_shipped} / ${count_unique_items_shipped}
    columns:
      - name: item_id
        description: 'Unique ID for items ordered.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
          metrics:
            count_unique_items:
              type: count_distinct
            count_unique_items_shipped:
              type: count_distinct
              filters:
                - status: 'shipped'
      - name: item_cost
        description: 'Cost for each item ordered.'
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: number
          metrics:
            total_cost:
              type: sum
            total_cost_of_shipped:
              type: sum
              filters:
                - status: 'shipped'
```

## Format

You can use the `format` parameter to have your metrics show in a particular format in Lightdash. These are the options:

| Option  | Description                                                                         | Raw value  | Displayed value |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| km      | Adds the suffix `km` to your value                                                  | 10         | 10 km           |
| mi      | Adds the suffix `mile` to your value                                                | 10         | 10 mi           |
| usd     | Adds the `$` symbol to your number value                                            | 10         | $10.00          |
| gbp     | Adds the `£` symbol to your number value                                            | 10         | £10.00          |
| eur     | Adds the `€` symbol to your number value                                            | 10         | €10.00          |
| percent | Adds the `%` symbol and multiplies your value by 100                                | 0.1        | %10             |
| id      | Removes commas and spaces from number or string types so that they appear like IDs. | 12,389,572 | 12389572        |
