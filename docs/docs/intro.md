# Lightdash

Connect Lightdash to your dbt project, add metrics directly in your data transformation layer, then create and share your insights with your team.

Our mission is simple: we want to enable everybody in your company to answer their own questions using data.

## Check out Lightdash in action

1. [Check out the example project](http://demo.lightdash.com/) where you can click around and see Lightdash in action - no installation required!
2. Demos are fun and all, but to get the full Lightdash experience, we recommend working through our [install guide](get-started/setup-lightdash/install-lightdash.mdx) and hooking it up to your own project 😊
