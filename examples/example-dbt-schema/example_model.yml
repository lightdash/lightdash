    # If we want to join this model to other models in lightdash, we need to define this in the .yml file.
    # We add joins at the same indentation level as our model's name, description, etc. in a `meta` block
    # You can join multiple models other models to your model.
    # All joins are left-outer joins.

      joins:
        - join: segment_web_sessions # name of model you're joining to
          left_on: user_id # join key of left model (i.e. this model)

    # For a column to appear in lightdash, it needs to be defined in the model's .yml file.
    # To define a column, you only need to include the column name (descriptions are optional).
    # All of the column descriptions are automatically pulled into lightdash.
