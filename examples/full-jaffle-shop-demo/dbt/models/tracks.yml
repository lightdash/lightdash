                **Unique Event Count** provides a distinct count of tracked events in the system.

                - Counts each unique event type only once
                - Useful for analyzing event diversity
                - *Note*: This differs from `event_count` which includes duplicates

                ### Common Use Cases
                * Measuring feature adoption
                * Analyzing user engagement patterns
                * Tracking product usage variety
