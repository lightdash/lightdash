      This model demonstrates Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD Type 2) patterns with temporal validity:
      - Each address has valid_from and valid_to timestamps
      - Current addresses have NULL valid_to values
      - Historical addresses show when they were active
      - This allows for point-in-time analysis and historical reporting
