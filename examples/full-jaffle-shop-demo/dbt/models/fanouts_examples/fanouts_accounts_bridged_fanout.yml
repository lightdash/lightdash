      This model demonstrates a many-to-many join pattern that creates extreme metric inflation:
      Accounts ‚Üí Deals ‚Üí User_Deals (junction table) ‚Üí Users

      This creates a complex fanout where:
      - Each account can have multiple deals
      - Each deal can have multiple users (through the junction table)
      - Each user can work on multiple deals (through the junction table)
      
      The result is that account records get multiplied by the total number of user-deal combinations,
      creating extreme fanout that significantly inflates COUNT metrics while leaving COUNT_DISTINCT safe.
      
      This demonstrates how many-to-many relationships through junction tables can create 
      multiplicative fanout effects that are much more severe than simple 1-to-many joins.
