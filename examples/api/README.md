# HTTP Client API Examples

Use these files with your IDEs HTTP client to exercise API calls. 

## Environment Variables

Copy http-client.env.json to http-client.private.env.json and fill in the required values. You can override
any values in the public env file by adding them to your private env file.

Using this env file will allow you to leverage the variables defined within it in your HTTP client requests.
