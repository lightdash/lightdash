# Dashboard controls

Wording: a *control* is a *filter control* on the bar: it narrows data through
fields. User-facing copy says *tile*, never *chart*.

- **Flag**: `FeatureFlags.DashboardControls` (`dashboard-controls`), read with
  `useServerFeatureFlag`. Flag off means the dashboard behaves as today.
- **Shipped components are imported, not restated.** Import from
  `features/dashboardFilters`, `features/parameters` and `features/dateZoom`.
  A shipped file is edited only by a pure move into an exported piece, or by
  an optional prop whose default is today's behaviour; see "Openings in
  shipped files".
- Saved data keeps today's `DashboardFilterRule` shape.

## Gated lines in shipped files

- `features/dashboardTabs/index.tsx` picks `ControlsBar` instead of
  `DashboardFiltersBar`.
- `pages/Dashboard.tsx` picks `ControlsSidebarPage` instead of `Page` and wraps
  the header in `DashboardHeaderGuard` (inert while the sidebar is open).

## Openings in shipped files

Each is a pure move or an optional prop that defaults to today's behaviour.
All are in `features/dashboardFilters/`.

- `DashboardFiltersBar`: `filterArea`, which replaces the shipped filters and
  the requirements button (default: both, as today).
- `ActiveFilters/`: `FilterRuleLabel`, `TemporaryFilters`, `UnresolvedFilter`,
  `useFilterTabPlacement`, `filterLabels`, `filterLock` and `filterOrder`,
  moved out of `index.tsx` and `Filter.tsx`.

In `FilterConfiguration/`:

- `FilterSettings`: `hideLabel`, `hideRequiredCard` (both default false).
- `FilterFieldSelect`: `defaultOpened` (default false). Its input also sets
  `aria-expanded`, for everyone.
- `SqlColumnSelect`: the "Select a column to filter" select, moved out of
  `index.tsx`.
- `utils`: `getDefaultField`, `getUniqueSqlColumns`,
  `getSqlColumnFilterType` and `getFilterRuleWithDisabledState`, moved out of
  `index.tsx`.

## Bar and page

- `ControlsSidebarPage` is a drop-in for `components/common/Page/Page`. It always
  passes `ControlSidebar` as the left sidebar and toggles only `isSidebarOpen`,
  so the dashboard grid never remounts.
- `ControlsBar` is the shipped `DashboardFiltersBar` with its one opening,
  `filterArea`: the slot that replaces `DashboardFilters` and the requirements
  button. In edit mode it holds `FilterPills` and the shipped
  requirements button (hidden while the sidebar is open); in view mode nothing
  is passed, so the bar is the shipped one. Separators, parameters, date zoom,
  the hide button, the compact drawer and the `data-tour-*` anchors are the
  shipped bar's own.
- `FilterPills`: click opens the control, the X removes it and is hidden while
  the sidebar is open. Dimension rules and metric rules are two dnd-kit
  contexts, reordered within their own list (the shipped `moveFilterRule`);
  dragging and the grip are off while the sidebar is open.
- One saved rule is one `FilterPill` (memoised; pass it primitives, the rule
  and the field). Only its button is the feature's (click opens the editor,
  `aria-pressed`, the selected look). Everything else is extracted
  from the shipped pill, in `dashboardFilters/ActiveFilters`, and called from
  both sides:
  - `FilterRuleLabel`: name, "is any value", two values then "+N", the tables
    tooltip (off on the pill being edited).
  - `useFilterTabPlacement` and `isFilterHiddenOnTab`: the tabs a rule is on,
    hidden on this tab, the "not applied" state and its tooltip. The pill
    being edited shows on every tab.
  - `filterLabels.ts`, `filterOrder.ts`: the label rules and the reorder.
- A rule whose field cannot be resolved renders the shipped `UnresolvedFilter`
  (invalid or locked) and opens no editor. Nothing is called unresolved while
  the fields load.
- `TemporaryFilterPills` renders the shipped `TemporaryFilters` after the saved
  pills, inside the shipped `FiltersProvider` its popover needs: outline pill,
  its own popover and an X. They are never opened in the sidebar.

## Provider contract (`useControlsSidebar`)

- The context is a `use-context-selector` context, like the dashboard's.
  `useControlsSidebarSelector((c) => c.x)` re-renders its component's subtree
  only when the selected value changes; use it in anything rendered
  per pill or around the whole page. `useControlsSidebar()` returns the whole
  value and re-renders on every change. A selector must return
  a value that is stable for the same state (no new object or array).
- Every callback in the value keeps one identity for the provider's life. They
  read state through the `latest` ref in `ControlsSidebarProvider`, which is
  synced after each render and written eagerly by the `write*` helpers, so two
  calls in one event (`updateFilter` with a label, then `close`) agree. A new
  callback reads `latest.current`, never render state, and writes through the
  helpers.
- `open(id)` snapshots the dashboard filters and edits a saved filter control.
- `updateFilter(rule)` writes to the dashboard context, so tiles preview live.
- `close()` keeps the edits: they already live in the dashboard draft.
- A label is optional. A filter with none shows its field's name, as the
  shipped bar does.
- `discard()` restores the snapshot taken when the control was opened. Saving
  to the server stays with the dashboard's own Save. Pure helpers:
  `sidebarState.ts`.

## Dismissing (`useEditorDismiss`)

- Escape is one capture listener on `document`, attached while the editor is
  open, so one press does one thing. In order: an open list, menu or popover
  (`aria-expanded="true"` on its target) or a modal owns the press; an input
  marked `data-own-escape` owns it (nothing carries it today);
  otherwise, with focus inside the editor (`data-controls-editor` on
  `EditorShell`), the focused input is blurred so its label commits and the
  editor closes as "Done" does. From the page, Escape never closes.

## Editor

- `EditorShell` is the one chrome for the sidebar: title, subtitle, More actions
  menu, a Close X, an `aboveTabs` slot for the label,
  body and a footer. The X and "Done" both call
  `close`; the quiet discard action ("Discard
  changes" once an existing one has changed) calls `discard`. Add chrome there.
- `ControlSidebar` edits the control from `useControlsSidebar`. A
  control is titled by its label, or by its field's name while it has none.
- The label is a local draft (`useLabelDraft`): the title follows the draft,
  and the control gets it after 300ms without typing, on blur and on Enter.
  Enter commits and the editor stays open. A label of
  spaces is written as no label. The placeholder is the name the control goes
  by when the label is empty. Blur commits synchronously, which is what lets
  "Done", the X, Escape and "Discard" see it. The editor body is mounted with
  the control id as `key`, so the draft restarts and a pending commit is
  dropped when another control opens.
- Focus: the label input has `autoFocus`, so it takes focus whenever the keyed
  editor mounts (from a pill, on a switch).
- The edited filter's field is resolved as the shipped bar does
  (`useFilterRuleField`, over the shipped `useDashboardFilterField`:
  dimensions and metrics, with the labels of the tile it is mapped on). A SQL
  column filter (`target.isSqlColumn`) has no field: it goes by its column
  name.
- `useSqlColumnsByTile` offers every filter every column of every SQL chart
  tile, whatever the types, as the shipped popover does
  (`TileFilterConfiguration`).
## Fields and tiles

A filter control can hold several fields, on today's saved shape (`peers.ts`):

- The first field is the rule's `target`.
- Another field on a tile is `tileTargets[tileUuid] = { fieldId, tableName }`.
- A tile left out is `tileTargets[tileUuid] = false`.
- A tile uses exactly one field of the filter, and a field belongs to a filter
  only through a tile mapping (`getFilterFields`).
- SQL chart tiles are mapped per tile with `isSqlColumn` targets
  (columns from `useSqlColumnsByTile`) and are never
  fields of the filter.
- A data app tile takes the filter as a whole, as in the shipped popover: on
  with no entry, off with `false`, never a field.
  It counts as filtered in the tab and sidebar counts.
- Counts (`getTabCounts`) use every tile on the tab or
  dashboard, not only the filterable ones.

## Motion

Values are the homepage builder's (`ee/features/homepageBuilder/HomepageEditor.module.css`),
restated, never imported. Each stylesheet declares the ones it uses once, as
custom properties on its root class:

- `--controls-duration-hover: 0.12s`
  with `--controls-ease: ease-in-out`.
- `--controls-duration-arrive: 0.28s` with
  `--controls-ease-arrive: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`, from transparent
  (the editor uses `translateX(-6px)`).
- Press is `scale(0.97)` on "Done".

Rules:

- Animate `opacity` and `transform` only. Never width, height, margin,
  position or `box-shadow`: these run once per tile. A shadow that has to
  appear sits on its own layer and that layer's opacity changes.
- No React state, effects, refs, timers or context for motion. Things arrive
  with a mount animation. The editor's
  content arrives, not its panel, so the page never shows through. Closing is
  immediate.
- Every animation and transition is switched off under
  `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` at the end of its stylesheet.
- No new `:has()` selectors.
