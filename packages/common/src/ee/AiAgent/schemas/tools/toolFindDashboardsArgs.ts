export const TOOL_FIND_DASHBOARDS_DESCRIPTION = `Tool: "findDashboards"
Purpose:
Finds dashboards by name or description within a project, returning detailed info about each.

Usage tips:
- IMPORTANT: Pass the user's full query or relevant portion directly (e.g., "revenue based on campaigns" instead of just "campaigns")
- The search engine understands natural language and context - more words provide better results
- You can provide multiple search queries to search for different dashboard topics simultaneously
- If results aren't relevant, retry with the full user query or more specific terms
- Results are paginated â€” use the page parameter to get more results if needed
- Dashboards with validation errors will be deprioritized
- Returns dashboard URLs when available
- It doesn't provide a dashboard summary yet, so don't suggest this capability
