- All permission checks are performed with CASL
- All permission logic is written in [organizationMemberAbility.ts](mdc:packages/common/src/authorization/organizationMemberAbility.ts) + [projectMemberAbility.ts](mdc:packages/common/src/authorization/projectMemberAbility.ts)
- All service methods must have permission checks
- Permission checks should use the [caslAuditWrapper.ts](mdc:packages/backend/src/logging/caslAuditWrapper.ts) for auditing
- Permission checks always execute against a subject using fields only from the subject
- Never insert user properties (including user's org uuid) in the subject field
